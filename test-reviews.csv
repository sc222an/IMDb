rw10286211,tt0094812,Bull Durham (1988),"The world of professional sports is incredibly complex. People forget just how many people play a given sport and make it to the top. People forget about all the people that aren't at the top and still playing. That's what this movie represents.nnKevin Costner plays Crash Davis a phenomenal ball player who is clearly past his window to be in the big leagues but still is tied up in the sport of baseball. He has a passion for it but can't leave it. Costner nails the role, and came off real to me.nnBaseball of course is a sport that really surrounds superstition and that's where this film nails it. Everything surrounds not breaking their routine. Susan Sarandon believes she is the key to a players success. It has proven her right over time and she continues to pick players to date each season. Other players on the ball team have their individual superstitions. But the big one is the streak. Nuke can't do anything with Annie otherwise it'll break the streak. I think this just represents a lot about the sport and it makes me laugh.nnThis movie isn't about a happy ending. It's about how many have tried and fallen short. Their presence was left with those who played with them and made them better. But in the end Crash holds a record in a minor league almost no one will remember. Its a reality for most athletes and this film displays it with some fun.",D,1/26/2025

The story, the acting, and especially Charlie's performance as Matt Murdock were incredible. So when I heard him talk about Kin, I knew I had to check it out.nnIn short, the atmosphere was convincing, and the show started strong, the actors were great, the vibe was there, but the writing let everything... or me only... down.nnIn long, the first few episodes had me hooked. It took a moment to stop seeing Daredevil in Charlie's performance, but he was just as good as I expected. The other leads were strong too, and the story pulled me in. But after a few episodes, things started to fall apart. The writing just wasn't there.nnThe biggest problem for me was Amanda's character. Her whole arc felt completely unrealistic and forced. Her sudden rise as a powerful figure in the gang made no sense and felt out of place in a gritty, grounded Irish gangster story. As an Eastern European woman, maybe I see things differently, but I just couldn't buy into her transformation. If this was a North American show, I'd call it ""woke,"" but in Ireland?!

In an odd twist, it suggests that rotary phones were secretly used to hack into government systems in a way that would make a modern cybersecurity expert laugh. Additionally, the film attributes the invention of poutine to a covert operation by undercover agents trying to ease public tensions, a claim that is both bizarre and laughable.

""One from the Heart"" was entirely filmed on Coppola's Zoetrope Studios, what brings to memory great movies of the Hollywood Studio Era. It really contributes perfectly to create ""dreamy"" mood of the film, it feels like a dream wondering through studio night Las Vegas probably as false as the real Las Vegas itself. And on this background we have a very simple and sweet romantic story of a love crisis in a relationship of a simple American couple wonderfully played by Terri Garr and Frederic Forrest.

Además, las canciones siguen siendo tan emocionantes como siempre, pero con un toque renovado que hace que se sientan actuales y emocionantes.nnEl elenco también hace un trabajo excelente: Melissa McCarthy como Úrsula tiene un carisma único y una energía divertida, mientras que los personajes secundarios, como Flounder y Sebastián, aportan ese toque de humor y calidez que tanto amamos. La historia sigue siendo tan encantadora como la original, pero lo que más me gusta es cómo logra mantenerse fiel a la esencia de la animación de 1989, mientras introduce elementos que enriquecen el relato.nnLo que realmente me sorprendió fue lo inclusiva que es esta nueva adaptación. La película no solo celebra la diversidad, sino que también transmite un mensaje importante sobre la importancia de seguir nuestros sueños y ser fieles a quienes somos.

Este musical, dirigido con una mano tan diestra como poética, es un espectáculo multisensorial que encapsula la esencia de Francia con una precisión deslumbrante y una sensibilidad que solo podría surgir de una profunda admiración por dicho país. Curiosamente, esta joya es, en esencia, una epístola cinematográfica de México hacia la tierra del vino, la revolución y la haute couture.nnLa trama, una reinterpretación contemporánea de los clásicos dramas de familias enfrentadas, sigue a Johanne y Arturo, dos almas intrépidas y transgénero cuyos corazones encuentran eco en el otro, aun cuando las líneas de sangre que los anteceden conspiran para mantenerlos separados. Las familias de ambos, acérrimas rivales en el mundo del comercio parisino simbolizan no solo la fractura de generaciones que privilegian el poder y la tradición por encima del entendimiento, sino también el conflicto entre las rígidas estructuras del pasado y el dinamismo liberador del presente.nnEl genio del guion radica en su capacidad para entrelazar esta narrativa profundamente humana con las exuberantes y deliciosamente pretenciosas canciones que conforman el corazón palpitante del filme. Cada número musical es una pieza magistralmente coreografiada que no sólo eleva las emociones de los personajes, sino que además sirve como un tributo a los grandes géneros musicales franceses: desde el cabaret melancólico hasta la chanson en su forma más luminosa.nnVisualmente, Johanne Sacreblu es un festín barroco de colores saturados y texturas opulentas que nos sumerge en un París de ensueño: una ciudad reinventada como un teatro de emociones exacerbadas. Sin embargo, más allá de su estética cuidadosamente elaborada, la película pulsa con un subtexto político y cultural ineludible. Es una declaración de amor hacia la Francia eterna, sí, pero también una invitación desde México -país que, a través de esta producción, se reafirma como un nodo cultural audaz y visionario- a repensar los paradigmas de identidad, familia y pertenencia.nnJohanne Sacreblu no es una película que simplemente se ve o se escucha; es una experiencia que se vive en cada fibra del ser. En su ambición desmedida y su apasionado exceso, encuentra su mayor virtud: una obra destinada a dividir opiniones, provocar debates y, sobre todo, dejar huella indeleble en el panorama cinematográfico global. Una película que, como el verdadero arte, no busca agradar a todos, sino tocar profundamente a quienes estén dispuestos a abrirse a su arrebatadora sinfonía de amor y resistencia.

Siempre llorando como Magdalena, y con razón, porque le pasa desastre tras desastre y tiene una vida muy caótica la verdad. No hubiera podido con tanto estrés y agonía de vivir con un amor prohibido pero estar obligada a tener a otro a mi lado, simplemente hubiera sido una vida muy infeliz.nn- Berny: la verdad muy buen chico, alma noble y guapo.nn- Óscar: pues sí, efectivamente, mijito, eras invisible para todos jsjsj para mí solo contaste como narrador de la historia, aunque me gustó que al final se haya desarrollado parte de su historia, porque sino, no solo hubiera sido invisible en la serie, sino para los espectadores también y no sería justo eso para el narrador y el que amarra los hilos de la historia.nnHablando de la última parte, me sorprende que Shaio y las demás socias nunca hayan sospechado de Nayibe, o sea, es obvio que ninguna persona trabaja gratis y que siga ahí con tantos lujos y cosas, pues era obvio que estaba en cosas turbias. Me sorprende cómo es que nunca la investigaron ni nada.nn- Nicolás: El plot twist sí es el de Nicolás, pobre chico que se quedó sin esposa y sin herencia jsjsjs bien merecido se lo tenía, pues en un episodio se deja en claro que él tampoco quiere a Shaio, sino la tranquilidad de vivir sin trabajar por casarse con ella, pero aún así me sorprende cómo es que puede fingir tanto quererla y de verdad seguirla como perro.nn- Ana Vanessa: A pesar de que aparece como la cara de la serie (aparece como la cara de la serie en el catálogo de Netflix y en el openning), en verdad no aporta mucho a la trama. Como personaje, es buena persona y me sorprende que Shaio la haya ayudado tanto a pesar de que era interés amoroso de Berny, pero me alegra que no hayan promovido rivalidad entre las dos por un hombre. Andrea Vanessa se tenía bien merecido llegar hasta donde llegó.nn- Kelly: La pobre Kelly, a ella y a mi Shaio la hicieron sufrir demasiado en la serie, pero qué bueno que haya llegado el amor a su vida. Me dio pena que al final ella no haya sido tan famosa como Andrea Vanessa, cuando era la que inicialmente las trajo a Bogotá.nn- Juanita: De Juanita me gustaron más los outfits que otra cosa.nnAlgo que me pareció interesante de la serie es la capacidad para negociar que tienen los personajes, aunque más para negociar, diría que para manipular a los demás según sus intereses. Toda la serie se basa en quién tiene el poder sobre el otro para controlar él la situación, ""Dices que me vas a manipular con este secreto? Aaaah, pero no te olvides que yo sé este secreto tuyo"", o ""Dices que me importa esto y por eso debería hacerte caso?

rw10285831,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"Emilia Pérez seems to confirm how the Internet and Hollywood are two very different worlds -- and I'm not yet sure which one can be labeled ""reality"".nnIf you simply read festival coverages of it or check how many laudatory reviews and awards/nominations the film has amassed, you'd probably think it's quite the groundbreaking musical masterpiece. If you went on TikTok or Twitter and checked how the average-Joe doom-scrollers feel about the movie, however, you'd likely come to expect a sh*tshow for the ages; a film to possibly one day be named in the same breath as Breen or Wiseau.nnIf nothing else, it's one of the most contentious Oscar-season movies since 2005's Crash (which was similarly lauded by some for its important themes about racism, mainly by those who knew as little about racism as the filmmakers) -- heck, a Best Picture win isn't out of the question. And that's not to say that everyone with a social media account hated the movie. A silent majority of normies probably liked it fine -- unbothered by its supposedly progressive view of trans issues that is usually anything but -- and it does have a dedicated defense brigade of people who have a sufficiently reductive/condescending view of Mexican culture, womanhood, and trans people to think that this film is exactly as progressive as it professes to be.nnUnfortunately, the defenses don't really work. A popular one seems to be that, even if we grant that the film is ""problematic"", trans people should be happy about getting ANY representation whatsoever, which is a wild thing to say when better films about the trans experience (chiefly The People's Joker and I Saw the TV Glow) came out the same year but went ignored by awards organizations. There is absolutely no reason to be satisfied with what's put before us in Emilia Peréz.nnAnother defense is that the film is going for ""camp"", ergo many of the problems that naysayers identify -- especially with regards to the quality of the songs and performances thereof -- are actually ""supposed"" to be there, but this has repeatedly been rebutted with yet another superior effort to check out, namely the campy and crazy Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008). Once again, there's no reason to shrug and go ""Well, I guess this is as good as we're gonna get"", especially when Emilia Pérez is never as campy or funny-bad as that one song number that went viral a few weeks ago (making it very funny that the same morons that defend its ""campiness"" will accuse OTHER people of basing their disdain toward the film on ONE scene).nnAs for Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez's supposedly being so perfect for these roles that Jacques Audiard absolutely could not have cast people whose first language is actually Spanish... Uhh, no. (You can tell that a good chunk of the principal actors don't have Spanish as their first language and somehow also sense the fact that their director speaks neither that one nor English fluently.)nnWhen I tell people to watch more movies, I don't ONLY mean that one should look beyond the Hollywood blockbuster bubble. You should also be aware that, say, Emilia Pérez isn't the best option when it comes to more artsy films.nnAll that being said, however, I understand the inclination to defend the movie. In saying that this is a considerably contentious film, I am of course also talking about the outrage from TERFs and Daily Wire readers about Karla Sofía Gascón's ""stealing"" the Oscar from Real Women™ in what Ben ""Wet-ass P-word"" Shapiro called the woke-est Oscar nomination ever. Her winning (which seems likely) will no doubt be seen as a blow against those bigots and, by extension, the new US presidential administration -- same if we indeed get the first foreign-language Best Picture win since Parasite.nnI don't know that such a gesture would fix anything, especially given the aforementioned issues with the representation.

If movies really are nothing more than mimesis or imitation of life, and therefore just... metaphor, let's look at the film's titular figure and what she represents. In the world of the film, being male is almost exclusively characterized as being toxically violent and inhumane. The film also implies that the only real chance for redemption in the broken world it depicts is for the male symbol to renounce his masculinity and become a woman. Once this transition happens, the character is suddenly benevolent, non violent and humane and solely focused on righting the wrongs of the world. Its an unmistakable implied misandrist message and it falls in line with all the cries of ""death to the patriarchy"" we hear at this moment of time. As if these cries and a film like this are really going to solve any problems. Men are half the population. They cannot and should not be defined in one pat simplistic stroke like this film paints.

rw10285806,tt21279420,Emergency (2025),"Kangana Ranaut's Emergency is a colossal disappointment and a testament to how historical films can go horribly wrong when accuracy and integrity are sacrificed for creative liberties. The movie, which attempts to portray one of India's most politically turbulent periods under the Emergency, comes across as a shallow, poorly researched project riddled with false narratives and one-dimensional storytelling.nnOne of the most glaring issues is the blatant misrepresentation of historical facts. The portrayal of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, one of South Asia's most iconic leaders, is not only inaccurate but also disrespectful. The dialogues and actions attributed to him in the film are completely fabricated, creating a false narrative that diminishes his legacy. Mujib never delivered the kinds of speeches shown in the movie, and these inaccuracies make it clear that the film has no interest in staying true to history. For viewers familiar with the real events, this distortion feels like a deliberate attempt to misinform and sensationalize rather than educate.nnKangana Ranaut's decision to direct and play the role of Indira Gandhi herself is another major flaw. While taking on such a monumental role requires immense skill and depth, her performance is underwhelming and lacks the gravitas needed to portray someone as complex as Indira Gandhi. Instead of embodying the essence of the former Prime Minister, Kangana resorts to over-the-top mimicry, which feels like a caricature rather than a respectful portrayal. Her exaggerated mannerisms and forced dialogue delivery make it difficult to take her seriously, turning what could have been a nuanced performance into an almost laughable parody.nnAs a director, Kangana seems to struggle with maintaining focus and depth in the storytelling. The narrative jumps around without a clear direction, and the emotional weight of the Emergency period is never truly captured. The film tries to juggle too many subplots and characters, but none of them are given the depth or development they deserve. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes dragging unnecessarily while others rush through crucial moments without giving the audience time to process their significance.nnThe production design and cinematography, while adequate in some parts, fail to elevate the film. The lack of attention to detail is evident in the costumes, sets, and overall atmosphere, which fail to convincingly transport the viewer back to the 1970s. The music and background score are equally uninspired, doing little to enhance the film's impact or mood.nnOne of the most disappointing aspects of Emergency is its inability to handle its subject matter with the seriousness and respect it deserves. The Emergency period was a dark and complex chapter in Indian history, marked by political oppression, human rights violations, and widespread fear. Instead of delving into these complexities, the film opts for melodrama and oversimplification, reducing the entire period to a black-and-white narrative that lacks nuance or substance.nnKangana's apparent need to control every aspect of the film, from direction to acting, seems to have backfired. Her vision for the project appears to be more about showcasing herself than about telling an important story. This self-indulgence is evident throughout the film, as the focus remains firmly on her character at the expense of other important figures and events.nnOverall, Emergency is a wasted opportunity. It had the potential to be a gripping political drama that sheds light on a pivotal moment in India's history, but instead, it ends up being a shallow, poorly executed vanity project. For viewers seeking an accurate or meaningful depiction of the Emergency period, this film will be a huge disappointment. It's hard to recommend this movie to anyone, as it fails both as a historical drama and as a piece of cinema. Skip this one-it's not worth your time or attention.",D,1/26/2025

It's not terrible, but there's really nothing special about it either. The conflict is flat, there aren't any truly emotional or gripping moments. Sure, there are a few touching episodes, but everything feels half baked. The themes of family, love, and self discovery could've been executed more effectively, but instead, they come across as bland. The ""miracle"" premise had so much potential to be impactful, yet it falls flat. The one thing I did enjoy was the characters, mainly the female ones because, well, they're gorgeous. Guilty pleasure, I guess wkwkwk.nnWhat's even more frustrating is how no one around Hong Dae-young seemed suspicious when he suddenly appeared as a younger version of himself. Like, how does no one notice how much he looks and acts like the younger Dae-young? It's honestly annoying because it makes the plot feel a bit too dumbed down. Even in a fantasy drama, some basic logic would've helped. 18 Again feels like a genre package straight out to nh.net sites (IYKWIM) with fanservice for a broad audience.nnNow I'm curious about Death's Game (2023) since it's from the same director.

Me recordó mi visita a la ciudad, cuando vi a ratas del tamaño de chihuahuas -o quizás terneros pequeños- peleando por una bolsa de basura como si fuese el último acto de Les Misérables. Esa escena quedó grabada en mi memoria como un símbolo de resistencia, y Johanne Sacreblue logra transmitir esa misma lucha cruda, humana y, sí, ligeramente pestilente, con una honestidad aplastante.nnEs un cortometraje que no solo te transporta a las entrañas de Francia, sino que te deja con la sensación de que, al final, todos somos ratas luchando por una bolsa de basura emocional.

It's more than just a film-it's an experience, a phenomenon, and a masterstroke of modern Indian cinema.nnPrabhas, our Darling, is an unstoppable force in this film, delivering a performance so intense and magnetic that it feels almost divine. Every time he's on screen, you can feel the sheer weight of his charisma-he doesn't just act; he commands. Whether it's his iconic dialogue delivery, bone-crushing action sequences, or the way he carries himself with that larger-than-life aura, Prabhas redefines what it means to be a superstar.nnAnd then there's Prithviraj Sukumaran, bringing his A-game and matching Prabhas stride for stride. The synergy between these two legends is electric, creating moments that make your heart race and your eyes widen in awe. Together, they make Salaar not just a film but an epic clash of titans.nnPrashanth Neel, the genius behind the camera, has taken storytelling and action to an entirely new level. His vision for Salaar is nothing short of revolutionary, blending raw emotion with jaw-dropping spectacle. The action choreography is a masterpiece in itself, especially the iconic Kateramma fight sequence-a scene so explosive, so perfectly staged, it's practically burned into the minds of every fan. It's not just a fight; it's an art form, a symphony of chaos and power that sets a new standard for action in Indian cinema.nnAnd let's talk about the music. The background score is pure fire, with tracks like **Chaos of KhanSaar Theme** and **Varadha Raja Mannar vs. Deva** elevating every moment to legendary status. But it's the **Kateramma Fight BGM** that truly steals the show-it's not just music; it's an experience that sends chills down your spine and leaves you breathless.nnWatching Salaar in theaters is an unforgettable event. The roars of the crowd, the larger-than-life visuals, and the raw energy of Prabhas are unparalleled. But it's in the rewatch, with the music and moments sinking in deeper, that you truly grasp the brilliance of what this movie offers.nnSalaar isn't just entertainment-it's a love letter to fans, a testament to the power of cinema, and a reminder of why Prabhas is the reigning king of the box office. It's a film that leaves you speechless, makes your heart race, and has you cheering like there's no tomorrow. This is not just a movie; this is *Salaar.*",D,1/26/2025

A lot actually. Personalities seem to be well developed ( alas character depth less so , more on that later ). Level of acting is acceptable ,as is the rest of the production.nnWhat does not work: Yeah, the audio is not fitting with the sera and cheapens the show. At start I was actually smiling as I head a little ditty that gave me happy memories of the WW2 classics of old. ACDC is, at the moment at least, for me tied too much to Marvel Universe and it ruined the immersion. I am struggling with some of the characters, at no point am I convinced of the need of the lady from french intelligence, other then a love interest? Then there is the cramped woke reek that also makes it appearance in this show. Don't get me wrong, I have no issues with minorities popping up in a show , but please make it more then a tick in the box cameo. Character depth, at the end of season one I still have so many questions why certain people behave the way they do in this show, particular the senrior leaadership. Storyline tends to be a bit chaotic, at least in the first season, the general feel was that producer and director were not convinced of a second season.

While the film delivers on visual spectacle and compelling performances, its portrayal of historical events is riddled with inaccuracies that are hard to overlook.nnThe film attempts to bring a specific historical event or figure to life, but rather than faithfully depict what happened, it opts for dramatic embellishments that serve the story more than the truth. The portrayal of key historical figure or event, for instance, is far from accurate. Characters are shown acting in ways that contradict documented behavior, and pivotal moments are reshaped to fit a more cinematic narrative, which leads to a distorted version of history. For example,is shown happening in a completely different setting, with a timeline that overlooks key developments that would have made the story more grounded in reality.nnMoreover, the filmmakers seem to take liberties with the cultural and political contexts, which reduces the richness of the historical landscape they were trying to recreate. These inaccuracies can be particularly frustrating for history buffs, as they obscure the real-world significance of the event or person being portrayed. It's one thing to alter certain aspects for artistic reasons, but when fundamental truths are altered or omitted, the film risks misinforming the public about the past.nnWhile ""Historical Epic"" is undoubtedly entertaining, its misrepresentation of history raises questions about the ethical responsibility filmmakers have when telling stories based on real events. Audiences who come to the movie for a more educational experience may leave with a warped understanding of history, which is troubling.nnUltimately, the movie serves as a reminder that history is not just a collection of stories to be molded for entertainment, but a complex series of events that deserve respect and accuracy. If you're watching for the drama, it's a fine spectacle. If you're hoping for historical accuracy, you may want to look elsewhere.",D,1/26/2025

Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more.

Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it.

If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",D,1/26/2025

This is a typical woke series that tries to appear neutral but primarily focuses on criticizing men.nnThe story follows four friends in their 40s:nn1. Pedro, a TV producer, is portrayed as outwardly confident but deeply insecure. He is dumped by his girlfriend Daniela and even spat on by an elderly woman for expressing a differing opinion.nn2. Raúl, an irresponsible man who, despite having a beautiful girlfriend, Luz, cheats on her with escorts and his co-worker's wife. When Luz suggests an open relationship, Raúl becomes jealous, and she eventually leaves him after selling his restaurant shares for a single euro.nn3. Santi, the most frustrating character, is already passive but becomes completely submissive to his daughter. Raúl even jokes, ""She has you on a leash, huh?"" Santi abandons a great woman to reconcile with his unfaithful ex-wife.nn4. Luis, the most relatable of the group, is a kind and caring husband who cooks and looks after the kids. However, his wife, Esther, cheats on him with her gym trainer due to dissatisfaction in their intimate life. She later returns to Luis after being dumped by the trainer.nnThe series seems to suggest that women are always justified in their actions, no matter the circumstances, which feels one-sided.nnFrom a technical standpoint, the acting and storytelling are average. The direction and editing leave much to be desired, with scenes cutting abruptly, disrupting the flow. The comedy is hit-or-miss, working about 50% of the time.nnFinal verdict: This series had the potential to be great but is let down by its lack of balance and nuance.",D,1/26/2025

rw10285404,tt8368368,The Apprentice (2024),"On the outside looking in, The Apprentice is the story of the rise of Donald Trump and his real estate business empire. It's also a behind the scenes look at longtime friends Roy Cohn and Donald J. Trump from the 1970s until 1986. The film showcases the story of both men in a provocative, yet humanizing and intriguing way, with love and sometimes hate towards one another. Cohn had been a prosecutor long before he met and became a mentor to Trump. It was fascinating to learn that Cohn was involved with the Rosenbergs trial and prosecution.nnThere are scenes in the film that can seem biased against Trump, and even caused Donald Trump himself to try and stop the release of the film, albeit unsuccessfully. One of those scenes involves Donald and his first wife Ivana being intimate, but the context was taken directly from first hand testimony from Ivana Trump herself when she divorced Donald. The second half of the film deals with the AIDS epidemic during the early 1980s, which was a scare to everyone because no one knew anything about it; and just the admittance of having AIDS was a social death sentence.nnI myself am not sure how Trump reacted to the AIDS epidemic, this was most likely dramatized for the film; especially when it came to the fact that Roy Cohn vehemently denied contracting the disease, but later died having been fighting it until his death. I do wonder if there will be a sequel to this film, bringing to light the next chapter of Trump's life. It'd be interesting to see, at least in a historic basis.",D,1/26/2025

rw10285325,tt28607951,Anora (2024),"This is one of the types o movies that just because its not ""standard"" it gets waaaaay much higher scores and because pleb genz kids rate nudity high in movies. And its because they suck at socialising in real life and thus even though the movie has ZERO relevance of conversation in relation to the relationship it passes anyway by just playing music and letting them party throughout that time period and leaving out any relevant conversation. A girl like that in reality will NOT fall in love with such a kid and she will use him for the money or tell him to fuck off and not wanting to be close.nnThe movie fails in this aspect of understanding humans but then again most people dont have a high IQ in relation to EQ to understand the probabilitets of human behavior.nnFor just a basic example where it fails yet again is that it srsly demonstrates that a person that brokes his nose is more urgent than somebody that has gotten bitten by another human and at the NECK. Zero understanding of injury relation between the two.nnFurthermore, in what kind of fantasy world do you live in where you think a man will treat a women with respect after she bites you? Come on, so many instances that makes this movie be waaaaaaay below 7.8. I dont normally write reviews but when we who have standards and in general only watch things that are reated above 7.0 and then see a 7.8 rating then we expect it to be very good in EVERY aspect. The ONLY good aspect this movie has is that it opens up EQ to low EQ humans about that sex workers are also humans but if you need a movie to tell you that you fucking braindead to be honest and they give out 10s because they never in their life had that kind of thoughts before.nnAlso where is the comedy? There is not one single line of replies that are actually wow funny. You can literally see the fake laughs the actors does from the most stupid ass conversations ever.nnSame again with an instance, its cold outside and this guy does not offer the .scarf until very late like wtf are you doing and another case where the guy would not give a fuck about giving a scarf to a girl that literally bite your neck that could have IN REALITY caused death.",D,1/26/2025

I watched at first just because it's ponderous, mysterious style was unusual for TV. But I wasn't really engaged until a few episodes in when Emily Browning's Laura Moon burst in like a storm. She kept me going through the less entrancing parts of the show, which could be unpleasant and some tedious, *endless* sex scenes.nnSince I wasn't a huge fan of season 1, it took me a while to realize I wasn't enjoying season 2. It seemed like pretty much the same thing, only I found myself less interested and more restless. Even Laura Moon seemed less fun. I found it harder to follow the story, and there were none of those really striking moments that peppered season 1.nnI gave up at episode 4, which is basically groups of people having long, philosophical conversations interspersed with short scenes that carried the plot and that I couldn't make head or tail out of.nnWhen I came here to write a review, I discovered my disenchantment with season 2 was not an isolated reaction. In fact, a lot of the people who adored season 1 hated season 2. My reaction to both seasons is more muted, but generally 1 is interesting and 2 isn't.nnThis is almost certainly because for some reason Bryan Fuller was replaced as showrunner. I like some Fuller shows better than others (my favorite is Pushing Daisies), but he is someone with a distinct vision, and I'm not convinced his replacement has one of those.nnCheck out season 1.

The use of sound design and visuals creates a sense of unease, making it feel like the creatures could appear at any moment.nnSandra Bullock delivers a solid performance as Malorie, a mother who must navigate this treacherous world to protect her children. The supporting cast also does a great job of adding depth to the story.nnOne of the criticisms of the film is that it doesn't fully explore the mythology of the creatures, leaving some questions unanswered. However, this can also be seen as a strength, as it adds to the sense of mystery and uncertainty.nnOverall, ""Bird Box"" is a gripping thriller that will keep you invested in the story. If you enjoy post-apocalyptic films with a strong focus on tension and suspense, you'll likely enjoy ""Bird Box"".",D,1/26/2025

There is, of course, no hint here that the rebels were all racists who were full of the ""natural, God-given order"", that they were willing to go over dead bodies to maintain the backward status quo and their comfortable lives at the expense of others, and that they terrified their fellow citizens with stories of a black uprising organized by Lincoln. And there's no way they're going to spoil your experience with some black whipping... The truth is not in the middle here by any stretch and decent people should be ashamed at the thought that their ancestors practiced slavery long after most of the world had rejected it and were responsible for the greatest bloodshed in the Western Hemisphere and yet were such hypocrites that they called themselves ""Land of the Free"". But not the Americans, they feel pride... And what good is it that they put all the effort here making all those detailed uniforms and flags... It's not even worth talking about the filmmaking, because there's no filmmaking to speak of. And even though this is a film about war, there's not a single conflict in the script.

All of my stressors just went away and I feel like everything in my life is finally going the way I want it to. Deep down in my heart I know it is purely due to this show and series. I know that if I brutally got hit by a truck such as many people in this series have, I wouldn't die with any regrets as I have seen this show, and I know that is enough. The actors were oozing with inspiration as they beautifully expressed their emotions through their acting. The symphony of emotions and life lessons bouncing around in this show seemed to all fall into place at the end when they told me the lesson word for word. As a college of mine said, it is absolute PEAM. I implore you to treat yourself to this masterpiece. Additionally, the kissing scenes are so nuanced and deep, and I forget that they aren't just actors as they mash their tongues into each other like a clash of swords from two brave knights dueling their hearts out. April 19th should be a holiday for this revolutionary act. I really truly feel deeply connected to the separate characters, such as the creepy guy, or the other creepy guy, or the horrible kids, or even the suicide bomber mom. I have had this on repeat for hours and been stopped multiple times on the street. ""Kind sir what are you playing on that phone of yours?"" they ask, not ready for the masterpiece that they will soon watch. I reply ""The meaning of life,"" and gesture for him to come sit down on the nearby ledge of the bridge. I give him my left Airpod and together we watch the masterpiece that is this piece of cinema. Together we laughed, and cried, and shared special moments together. When he inevitably fell off of that bridge we both knew it was okay as he had reached enlightenment as had I (don't worry he's ok). I would spend my life savings to have a chance to meet the curators of this work of art, and I hope one day that gift will be blessed upon me. Until that day reaches me I will have to live with myself knowing that no piece of art in any media will ever top this. This is the peak of humanity. It's only downhill from here. This has made the world better, and I hope it can make your world better as it has mine. I can only assume part three of this storyline will be just as beautifully crafted and its predecessors. Thank you for what you have gifted upon us. Please, I beg of you, watch this, it will make you happier and a better person. 10 out of 10 would be a severe understatement, for this so I will let you think of the largest number you can think of, then square it, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, then square that, THEN take that number, and square it again, and only then can you add 1.3 more to that number and put that over 10.

De esos que te atormentan toda la vida, de joven y de mayor, siempre.nnTengo la teoría de que Franco fue un gran cinéfilo. De esos que veían dos o res películas por día. Cinéfago, si queremos llamarlo así. Seguramente las dos cosas.nnViendo esta película no puedo dejar de acordarme de El resplandor (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), una de las del director británico que más me gustan. La idea no es que esté copiada, ni mucho menos, pero tiene grandes similitudes. Un hotel, la soledad como motor de la historia, personajes frágiles. Hay multitud de diferencias, por supuesto: aquello era un hotel de montaña, éste de playa, los protagonistas allí eran el encargado y su familia, aquí unos huéspedes, la fragilidad mental del cuidador del hotel era la amenaza, y siempre para su familia, siendo aquí externa y únicamente para las mujeres protagonistas. Pero tiene algo de inspiración en aquella.nnFranco derrapa totalmente con la historia. Siempre cuenta lo mismo y siempre lo cuenta igual. Es de esos directores que no tiene gracia, pero sus películas se ven. No me gusta, pero las veo. Tiene un punto personal totalmente desinhibido, descocado, alocado, salvaje. Filma lo que le da la puñetera gana y consigue meter a espectadores en la sala de cine. No tiene ningún tipo de pretensión artística -como otros muchos, Ford mediante- y es plenamente consciente de que está realizando un producto de entretenimiento. Por eso se ven sus películas.nnLa cinta parece rodada en Canarias, porque aparece el árbol tan característico de las islas en varias tomas y la arena de la playa es de ese color negro volcánica tan característico. Además la estructura hotelera no parece de las clásica de la Costa del Sol.nnMe gusta ver las películas de Franco, que no es exactamente lo mismo de que me gusten las películas de él. No están entre mis favoritas y, sin embargo, veo sus cintas. Tiene don. Tiene algo.nnLo singular es que los zombies aparecen cuando sopla el viento. Cualquier excusa nos sirve para montar una historia.nnLos zombies son, es descarado, los de Ossorio, los de Armando de Ossorio. Esos zombies templarios que aparecen en determinadas circunstancias. Aquella construcción era más solvente, más sostenida, aquí parecen una anécdota. Además en las películas de Ossorio, que son tres o cuatro nada más (de esta trama) los ropajes estaban raídos y sucios, porque los protagonistas venían del medievo, y aquí están relativamente limpios.

There was a lot of confusion in the beginning, but i guess that was the point. It seemed to be the point most of the movie. Once you understand that you're left hoping and hanging on to the chance that things will work out, which they do, in a weird way. What i don't understand is that if the purpose of the movie was that love is meant to endure (in this case even through actual medical procedures) then why did it, even though the movie mostly pointed out how much Kate's character pretty much hated Jim's character and showed that through heavy drinking, insults and the insinuating threats of sleeping with others. And Jim's character, even though finds himself regretting the ""love extraction"", seems to be morally and emotionally hurt by his girlfriend repeatedly. Yes they find each other in the end, again, and sort of laugh it off after they hear all the horrible things they hate about each other on tape but what's really the point. If the point is ""for better or worse"" then it's a pretty watered down and almost overwhelmingly exhausting effort to keep something that was seemingly a half ass relationship with two unsure people. If that's love then Damn.... How far we have fallen.nnApart from the confusing plot i found some parts of the movie weird. Like Jim's extra long kid scene in the kitchen that while understandable seemed to be drawn out. Elijah Woods creepy ass character talking about stealing a patients panties was unnecessary. It was enough he was using someone else's memories to steal their love. And Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalos characters getting high, drunk and having sex around and pretty much on top an unconscious man during an extreme medical memory wipe, in his own tiny apartment. It just seems forced and didn't add anything to the actual movie. I thought the movie was ok apart from not feeling its true purpose so i was somewhat surprised to see the majority rating was 10s?

rw2555330,tt0979432,"""Boardwalk Empire"" (2010)","DELETE: A stinker. An immaculately crafted stinker but a stinker all the same. People talk about the period detail and historical accuracy as if that equals good TV. For those of you that didn't know, this isn't a documentary or a recreation. Boardwalk Empire is a work of fiction. Those irrelevancies aren't what makes me dislike this show though. Although it is amusing that a series which puts such a high value on realism contains such unrealistic violence and melodrama. My problem is that the storyline is mind numbingly slow paced and dull. Hardly anything happens and when it finally does it carries little to no impact because I have been bored into a waking sleep waiting for it to happen. nnEverybody's screwing everybody, everybody's down each others pants and up each others skirts, oh it's so ambiguous. Get over it, it's been done, before and better and cos this is TV and something worked once lets do it until everyone's so sick of it we'll never do it again...until we run out of ideas that is. Just check Kelsey Grammar in Boss and a plethora of others for this 'he's not good or bad he just is' characterisation. Darmody is the only character I care about and he's not in it enough. Ambiguity is good, people make mistakes, shades of grey blah blah but can you seriously say you are rooting for Nucky?nnLead characters have to be at least kinda likable. The lead character in this piece is a villain operating for money and power with no redeeming qualities. Tony Soprano was a dedicated family man. Bill Adama fervently cared for the survival of his fleet. Why doesn't Nucky take his money and retire somewhere good instead of staying in that damp, drab, grey wasteland he calls home. What's his motivation? Why should I want him to succeed? nnI would rather a show shot on a sound stage with cardboard sets and a great story than a show with a $500m budget and a boring one. I think the praise and accolades Boardwalk Empire has gained are based on the name power of Scorsese, Buscemi and HBO. Over time this series will not be mentioned in the same breath as The Sopranos or Deadwood. Don't believe the hype. Get off the bandwagon.",D,1/26/2025

This movie scars me not because of bad horror that it represents but how depressing effect have on the mind. Its like couple of depressing people got together and shared their miserable stories and then they make movie about that, about their morbid fantasies and also they are all almost broke and they cannot act. Put all this ingredients in one pot and we get toxic food which might make the rest of your day or even couple days depressed if you allow it to enter your mind. There are sometimes cheap horror movies being made that are actually good and do make a break into amazing success like Terrifier where acting and effects are suprisingly good even if its cheap, but most of cheap horror movies like those thousands of southern horror movies about crazy folk turning into more crazy and similarly like this cannot act and story is dumb and they have no money and director is even more dumb so... save your mind, watch the movies which have good reviews as this is mostly safe and critics rarely got it wrong, they do, but rarely.

rw10284682,tt21279420,Emergency (2025),"Emergency is an insult to history, particularly in its false and distorted portrayal of Bangladesh's liberation. The film trivializes the immense sacrifices of the Bangladeshi people and completely sidelines the critical role played by leaders during the 1971 Liberation War and later on the death of Sheikh Mujib. Instead of presenting a truthful and respectful narrative, it manipulates historical events to suit a biased and politically charged agenda.nnThe oversimplification and fictionalization of such a significant chapter in South Asian history are not only disappointing but deeply offensive. By prioritizing propaganda over authenticity, Emergency disrespects the legacy of millions who fought for Bangladesh's independence.

rw10284612,tt13111078,"""Lioness"" (2023)","It's awful, from the first episode to the last. We obviously know we'll be recruiting a new lioness, since Cruz made it clear she was done, and not coming back (*winks at you with both eyes*).nnI love a story of female empowerment and letting women run sh*t and kick *ss at it. This new season really had the women taking a huge backseat. I'm not sure if the point Sheridan was going for was that women do it better when we leave them to it? Or if he really just said f*** it, lets just make a lot of pew pew noises and hope no one notices that men are making all the dumb decisions and this entire season's plot makes no sense.nnThe only good: Zoe Saldana is always on point in a dramatic action role. I like her return here, but this show desperately needs better writers who know what talent they have. They just let her yell a whole lot this season which is a shame. I liked calm, measured Joe from season 1 much better.nnThe Bad: Everything else, but I am going to take a huge offense to a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter being called an APACHE over and over again. It would have taken 2 seconds to just change that word in the season's scripts. Blackhawks are cool, and do use the weapons shown on the rails, but they absolutely do not look anything like, nor have the tactical capability, of an Apache attack helicopter. I'll also take offense to our characters walking through the front of a helicopter's rotor arc while it's supposedly spinning. A seasoned pilot would know that is how you get your head chopped off. Everything regarding the use of aircraft and aircraft safety this season was just awful.nnAs soon as that ""APACHE"" helicopter showed up the whole season was immediately on blast from me.nnPut the bad*ss operator women back at the forefront, (h*ll, make it about Bobby, for god's sake). Kick Taylor Sheridan off of his own shows. Use the correct names for the military equipment you managed to get a hold of or get footage for. Edit your scripts. Make s**t believable, and something you can actually follow for a plot.nnSPOILERS FROM HERE:nnA U. S. congresswoman is kidnapped and her family is murdered for supporting the ability to use US troops on US soil (also not explored further) -she is taken just over the border into Mexico to ""probe"" the U. S. response to an act like this. Who is probing though? China, by way of Mexico, because they trade oil guys! It's a big deal. They send a rescue team, f*** s**t up, end up nose down in a typical Hollywood issue black SUV in the shallow river. One operator is dead, not from a bullet despite them flying, but from hanging loose in the rear of an SUV. Sheridan himself waxes poetic about this in a PSA that is basically: Do wear your seatbelt, kids!nnSomehow we hop from rescuing a congresswoman who asks for revenge for her family, to figuring out who sent the kidnappers: this is where I lose it: China, by way of Mexican Cartel-""Los Tigres""- sent the probe, because they want to know what the U. S. will do if they invade Taiwan? Or something. It doesn't matter. Nothing about this beginning of this will really matter the rest of the season. The only point to ""Los Tigres"" even being mentioned is that Kyle and everyone else but Joe, picks our new lioness who is related to the man who runs this cartel, his niece, an ""APACHE"" pilot, 800+ kill sheet, many medals. Josie Carillo.nnJoe under pressure gives in to their demand to recruit her, and we meet Josie Carillo on a FOB in Iraq after the QRF gets hit by an IED while traveling over land in humvees. Carillo flies in with her ""APACHE"" helicopter and blows the attackers to bits. Cool. So, we arrive on base, everyone has some scratches but mostly we're all fine and good. IEDs don't cause massive physical trauma or anything. Joe sees Carillo exiting the ""APACHE"", and Carillo comes screaming forward in a word vomit of reprimand for Joe and the QRF. A lot of screaming and d*** measuring to follow until Joe commandeers the FOB commander's office and orders Carillo to see her in there-at which point, she identifies herself as being with ""the Agency"". Carillo: ""You could have led with that"". From angry and pushy to instantly meek as a lamb. We never see angry, forceful, leadership Josie Carillo ever again.nnShe gets recruited, similar to the first season. We move along, to Carillo training! We have a single training session in close quarters combat pistol shooting, to train this ""APACHE"" pilot how to shoot around corners. (I seriously cannot remember her ever being in a situation where this was required of her, the QRF and their Gray Man buddies did all the entering). Quite a departure from Cruz last season getting the ever-loving s*** beat out of her for weeks, despite her being a Marine Raider (not as good as a SEAL, but still special forces, think Marine Green Beret). This pilot just gets to skate on by, in her terrible at everything, but flying a helicopter way.nnBy this time though, I think Episode 4, it's CLEAR to everyone that this pilot actually sucks, is a liar, and is DEFINITELY a liability to the mission. Re-enter CRUZ!!!! Joe gives her the choice to join the QRF again and Cruz refuses, but that's too bad because Joe has already had her re-assigned to her QRF team anyway. She's going to Shadow the newbie because she really, really sucks and cannot be trusted to do the job of killing her father. Cruz lends her enormous amount of expertise here, ""Maybe just have her like, FLIP her father for our team? Don't kill him.""nnI have not even touched on the human trafficking (mostly children) incident though? Wow, yeah there was that too. Lot of bangs. Drones with explosives attached to them? Someone with a su*c*de vest who blows up the ?DEA? Guys and the human sl*ve cargo. Everyone from QRF and Taylor Sheridan himself are fine though! DOESN'T MATTER THOUGH, THIS IS ANOTHER DEAD-END PLOT LINE.nnBack to our pilot: STILL BAD AT EVERYTHING, including convincing her father to flip.nnThere's not a lot of dialogue to this scene, just a tearful Baby Carillo, and angry Dad (who was spouting off angrily about women and gays, and gay women, being in the military a few minutes ago) BUT now he's MAD the CIA stole his gay daughter's military career to make her ask him to flip from being a Cartel money launderer. She says ""THEY KNOW"", he says, ""WHO KNOWS"", ""THEY KNOW"", and he slaps her face a few times in between these two sentences. That's the whole, flip to work for the CIA, conversation. The whole thing. Cruz flies in and grabs World's Best Dad and holds him at gun point. The whole FLIP DAD op goes to s***, immediately. QRF sweeps in, kills the guards from the house next door. Finds a maid with a wire.nnDEA contact gets dragged in for ""keeping information from the CIA"" (the wired maid, and the other house guards) and they beat the h*** out of him, including water torture. Then drag him in for a polygraph, because those are very reliable. We can skip ahead to them deciding he's a boy scout though. He's not important (neither was the maid) to any of the other plot points after that.nnMorgan Freeman authorizes a secret, even from the President, hit on two Chinese Nuclear scientists, on their way to Iran. So back to Iraq we go and our ""APACHE"" pilot gets to be the big cheese finally! Something she knows how to do and, we finally see her look sort of comfortable. They have a helicopter, an 8 man operator team, Hollywood's ""Infinite Ammo"" Cheat, and 2 scientists to kill. Oh and don't forget our ""APACHE"" pilot's HUGE pilot helmet? (What the h*** is that thing, where did you get it, why is it so large?)nnWhatever, it hardly matters: The ""APACHE"", gets shot in the tail and crashes with just our pilot Josie Carillo and Cruz inside, no co-pilot, or aircrew to operate the fancy weapons on board. These just shoot without anyone to press the go button I guess. Hollywood, baby. Cruz comes out of the crash pretty hardy, but Carillo gets a compound fractured leg and can't walk. She enters catatonic shock? But without being catatonic. The most batsh*t insane gunfight, fifteen minutes of ""guns firing"" soundtrack as Iraq? Iran? Sends their whole entire base out to attack the American squad.nn8 against a few hundred, plus APCs, and even a f****** tank, but Sheridan pops that bad boy one and takes it out single-handedly. Re-enter the Little Bird, Sheridan's well-loved tiny, shiny black helo to save the day with a strafing run, because the close air support drops just did not f*** up our foes well enough. We can destroy whole bases with CAS, but not a football size area with little men in it. Got it.nnCIA, Kaitlyn and Byron also give Dad Carillo a gun and he shoots his brother in the head so he's instantly the new head of Los Tigres Cartel. Flipped Dad after all and got their Chinese string-puller (remember this plot point? I didn't.) to take to Guantanamo.nnThe Iran-bound scientists die? I guess. They're not mentioned much in the aftermath of the most what the f*** season I have ever seen. We have two members of the QRF shot in arteries, one is a femoral artery, but whatever--they're alive after being DRIVEN back to the FOB. The uninjured Operators got to hitch a ride in the Tiny-Shiny Black Helicopter. Everyone is tearful, and regretful, and nobody knows what the mission was for anyway. So uh, Joe goes home to her husband who just is so forgiving and the perfect military guy-wife to ever exist. End season.nnSomeone help these writers. Someone get an actual military consultant.

It follows two best friends Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA) who are forced to come up with their rent money by the end of the day because Alyssa gave it to her leech of a f***boy Keshawn (Joshua Neal). Things get more complicated when their hunt takes them all around their neighborhood. This was a very fun movie. Not all of the jokes landed with me, but a good majority of them did. There are two things that make this movie worth seeing. The chemistry and comedic timing between Palmer and SZA were palpable. I believed they were best friends, no matter what mistakes they made (there were a lot). The second thing was the side characters. Most of them were hilarious, all of them felt relatable and surprisingly fleshed out. Detailing them would go into spoiler territory, and I don't go there.

The one thing that makes this movie so predictable even in the first 10 minutes is the screenplay. The way everyone comes to her even when she just comes home or she just screams ouch! (in a low voice). The way everything seems like 'this is not ordinary' made me guess that she is mentally disabled and the main character doesn't exist.

If they didn't include the part where she gets admitted in a mental hospital this movie would have been a lot better, maybe 4/10 but The only reason I would watch this movie is the actress who looks gorgeous and that's it.

Desperate to show she is worthy of her job, Vivian begs to take on a story she has passion for. She has to fight ""big mean men"" to get it. She complains about Donald Trump as a reason she has to fight for this job(very random insert and felt more like a forced political jab). She's pregnant, but seems to hate this fact. She tells her husband ""f*ck your sperm"" at one point while he is rubbing her back. While he is good to her, she just gripes at him the entire series, refusing to help him prepare the apartment for the baby. We are forced to travel this journey with her as our tour guide, watching her make strange faces, and overact when it's not necessary, distracting us from the story at hand. Perhaps My Girl was where her journey in Hollywood should have ended...nnNow that she gets to write her dream article(after defeating Donald Trump and her bosses) it turns out she's actually very bad at her job. Three elderly coworkers end up doing a lot of the work for her(in between complaining about Donald Trump- again- why? It does nothing to propel the story forward). She does a few interviews- some in luxury environments. She even gets a designer haircut for free. She complains about the wealthy, but benefits from them each time, including a night spent in the Hamptons, and a trip to Germany complete with a translator.nnBack home, the coworkers are doing all her background work and fact checking. The women throw in random complaints of misogyny WHERE THERE IS NONE. They're taken care of by the kindest men that they easily throw under the bus and it's so strange to witness the acrobatics the writers engage in to justify it. In fact, once she finally finishes the article and it is a success, her boss is thrilled and wants to give her a bigger office. This also upsets her and she runs into the bathroom to cry about it. Nothing is good enough for the emotional roller coaster that is this character.nnVivian refuses to rest, obsessing over her article(chalking it up to having a timeline at work but in reality she is completely obsessed with Anna)and drinks tons of coffee, teetering around griping about her baby on the way. Very disappointing to all mothers on this planet, I'm sure. They do try to give her a redemption moment by showing her smiling at her newborn... but she leaves it several months later for the trip to Germany. We never see Vivian bonding with her child- it is always in a carrier or a crib or her husband is holding it. So there wasn't even a character arc with the whole ""she is pregnant and angry about it but soon she'll see the fruits of her labors"" trope. Just a brief smile at her baby and then her telling people she's happy to be a mom. But this is just fill and fluff and it's boring. The story would have been 10x better without the journalism hook.nnAll in all, the story of Anna Delvey was far more compelling and would have benefited from a different tour guide rather than a grumpy pregnant Vivian who is given everything on a platter and can't even do a simple job on her own.",D,1/26/2025

The movie skillfully bring out how these rich Jews made their money by under paying employees and finally moved their factory abroad. It almost feels like a story of jealousy and how radical ideologies brought the rich middle class capitalist down with a revolution that takes them nowhere. The lovely stuttering daughter was sent off to New York to go to school and she was radicalized while she was there which sounds very similar to the woke movement in the last couple decades that has destroyed so many young people in America and encouraged them to revolt against mainstream capitalism and American traditions. Merry takes up a religion that takes her to a dark life of poverty, radical beliefs and solidarity. The final outcome of the glorious revolution but she is free now. The best part of the movie is Swede's rant to the psychologist spilling out the truth of what happened to Merry and how she was betrayed by her.

But Akshay Kumar was a horrible choice for the film not for his acting but for his disgusting actions in real life against Sikhs. He puts Sikhs down and degrades them but plays one to make a buck and that is utterly shameful and disgusting. The fact that most of the actors were Hindus who have tried for ages to commit genocide on Sikhs is unbearable to watch. This movie could have been so much better but it just once again shows how Bollywood will do whatever they can to demean Sikhs while trying to show the world they don't. This can be seen in any tv show especially on Colors network. How many Jews would play Nazis or better yet how many Nazis would play Jews? Yet here they use the Hindu ""Nazis"" to play Sikhs. The same Sikhs Hindus have begged to save them from Muslims are trying to kill them and that is the part that should give this film a one star but for sake of just the movie I give it an 6 but the actors especially Akshay Kumar was a crap stained slap in the face of Sikhs and any oppressed people.

It demonizes progressivism and exalts ultraconservative values, presenting a simplistic, Manichean narrative. Characters advocating freedom and questioning dogmas are vilified, while those representing traditional morality are glorified, perpetuating stereotypes and prejudices. The film manipulates faith and fear to create paranoia and promote intolerance, silencing dissent under the guise of order. Lacking depth and nuance, it simplifies complex themes into clichés, reducing its artistic and intellectual credibility. Instead of fostering constructive dialogue, it polarizes and deepens divisions, using cinematic language to push a reactionary agenda. By exploiting fears of ""the other,"" it undermines democracy and diversity, spreading hate and intolerance.

In realtà con 007 si collega in maniera soft, non invasivo, è palese che vengano riciclati oggetti di scena dei film, ambientazioni e soprattutto automobili. Una delle scene più emozionanti è quando le due concorrenti che arriveranno più in fondo hanno l'onore di salire a bordo della DB5 originale del film che ha anche gli accessori funzionanti! Una vera chicca (e che invidia).nnLa verità è che solo gli appassionati possono cogliere il tutto, se non si è visto la maggior parte dei film certe cose non si possono cogliere e si perde anche il contenuto narrativo della serie. Oltretutto per quanto Cox dica che i concorrenti siano uno spaccato dell'Inghilterra e del mondo in realtà sono tutti cittadini inglesi, magari figli di immigrati o immigrati ma sono tutti UK.nnLa serie ripeto troppo corta per seguire appieno le ben 9 coppie che giocano che in realtà non saranno mai 9, alcune coppie non esisteranno mai nella serie perché si autoeliminano al primo livello, alcune proseguono ma Amazon non ha proprio voglia di seguire la loro storia e si concentrerà sul racconto di 4-5.nnLa sfida è a livelli, ogni livello porta i soldi e più si va avanti più si guadagna. Il problema è la narrativa e il fatto che ogni coppia affronti i livelli in maniera completamente casuale, sia a livello di difficoltà che di location. Sfide troppo facili per alcuni, troppo complicate per altri. Anche il sistema delle domande finali è una cazzata allucinante, mi faccio kilometri e kilometri, affronto sfide alle volte durissime per poi buttare via tutto per una domanda che magari in quel momento non so rispondere o non ho la lucidità di pensare. Non basta già completare sfide difficili?nnLa cosa che più mi da noia è che la serie è basata su 007 ma in realtà non si collega in nessun modo al mondo Bond. I concorrenti non devono per forza sapere nulla dei film o dei romanzi di Fleming né tantomeno sembrano mai citare in nessun modo il mondo di Bond. Anche il ruolo di Cox, per quanto interessante, è abbastanza slegato dalla serie e sembra abbastanza futile nell'economia della serie.nnIl meccanismo del gioco è del tutto sconosciuto e fino alla fine non si riesce bene a capire del tutto perché è spiegato in maniera insufficiente e non sembra neanche molto di interesse tanto tutto si riduce a trovare ste benedette valigette e vincere sempre soldi no?nnUn consiglio? Se siete appassionati o meno di 007 cambia poco, è una serie passatempo e ve la mangiate in fretta, guardatevela ma più interessanti le prime puntate che le ultime e il che è tutto dire.

A trama serve como veículo para a disseminação de ideias que se alinham à extrema-direita, promovendo a polarização e o discurso de ódio, tão nefastos à sociedade contemporânea.nnA demonização do progressismo e a exaltação de valores ultraconservadores são elementos centrais na narrativa. Personagens que representam a liberdade individual e o questionamento de dogmas são retratados como ""marionetes do demônio"", enquanto aqueles que encarnam a moralidade tradicional e a subserviência à autoridade são apresentados como baluartes da virtude. Essa dicotomia simplista e maniqueísta não apenas empobrece o debate, mas também contribui para a demonização de grupos minoritários e a perpetuação de preconceitos.nnO filme se aproveita da fé e da religiosidade do público para incutir o medo do ""outro"", do diferente, do que não se encaixa nos padrões tradicionais. Essa estratégia, historicamente utilizada por movimentos de extrema-direita, busca criar um clima de paranoia e intolerância, em que o dissenso é silenciado em nome da ""salvação"" e da ""ordem"".nnA produção da Brasil Paralelo carece inteiramente de profundidade intelectual e se limita a reproduzir chavões e clichês do discurso reacionário.

rw10284135,tt13918776,"""The Night Agent"" (2023)","The Netflix series The Night Agent blatantly serves as a vehicle for anti-Iran propaganda, using its plot to reinforce harmful stereotypes and vilify an entire nation. Its portrayal of Iran as a shadowy, menacing adversary perpetuates a long-standing tradition in Western media of dehumanizing Middle Eastern countries to serve political agendas.nnFrom the outset, the series wastes no time in framing Iran as a hostile force, linking it to terrorism and clandestine threats against the West. This tired trope reduces Iran to a caricature of evil, disregarding the rich history, culture, and complexities of its people. The narrative's single-minded focus on portraying Iran as an antagonist mirrors the rhetoric of Western governments, which have historically sought to justify sanctions and interventions under the guise of protecting democracy.nnThe Iranian characters are portrayed without depth or humanity. They are depicted as ruthless and morally bankrupt, existing solely as obstacles for the heroic Western protagonists to overcome. This lack of nuance not only weakens the storytelling but also reinforces xenophobic stereotypes that paint Iranians as threats to global peace. By doing so, the series dehumanizes an entire population, erasing their struggles and reducing their identity to a monolithic image of villainy.nnWorse still, The Night Agent glorifies Western intelligence agencies as righteous defenders of freedom, conveniently ignoring the historical realities of Western interference in the Middle East. For example, the series makes no mention of the 1953 coup orchestrated by the CIA and MI6 that overthrew Iran's democratically elected government, leading to decades of instability. Instead, it perpetuates a narrative where the West is always the hero, further cementing a biased worldview.nnThis series arrives at a time of heightened tensions between the West and Iran, making its propagandistic elements even more concerning. By reinforcing negative stereotypes, The Night Agent risks influencing public opinion to support aggressive policies against Iran, contributing to a climate of misunderstanding and hostility.nnIn conclusion, The Night Agent is not just a poorly executed thriller; it is a dangerous piece of propaganda. Its one-dimensional portrayal of Iran and blind allegiance to Western political narratives serve to demonize a nation and its people. Viewers must approach this series with caution, recognizing it for what it is: a deliberate attempt to distort perceptions and fuel division.",D,1/26/2025

Why stick your hand into some hole in the box when you can just open it? There are so many bloggers on Youtube these days who are way more natural in exploring 'haunted' places. So many cliches.nnAnd then okay, what about this: your viewers numbers on this streaming platform grow to almost a million, every character is already psyched out, and then they confess that they made something up, but now it's all real, and finally they seem to be actually panicking and not fooling around, so what would happen in the real world? Answer: they would get their million of viewers, because this builds up trust in what's happening. What happens in fact? Their numbers drop to less than 1 thousand in a blink. And then, ridiculously, the two girls that are part of the background on the streaming platform stand up and vanish. And this is where I'm 100% on the same page with the girls.

Anyway;nn-The acting is okay, varies in quality substantially and you can kind of excuse some of the bad acting from those specific characters being trapped in a vault and so not socially adjusted.nn-The plot is driven forwards by a huge number of ridiculous coincidences, which is kind of irritating.nn-Several plots occur only because characters do not think to tell obvious things, that are not even secrets, to other characters who are already clearly suspicious. This seems to occur solely so that the plot can happen, there's never an actual reason for it.nn-The characters vary in ""power"" and competency fairly wild, so as to allow the plot to continue. For example one character is completely unable to deal with a kind of threat and then a couple of episodes later he gives a cool monologue about how he's always been able to deal with that kind of threat easily because of an obvious weakpoint the threat has and then singlehandedly takes down hundreds of them. And it is not as if he found out how to handle the threat in the period between the events in each episode, supposedly he has had this knowledge for decades.nn-Finally the show breaks fallout's lore, especially regarding what technology existed pre-war, and in significant ways, though I don't know if I can explain it without spoilers... Let's see if I can be vague... One of the key elements that the plot revolves around is the characters trying to acquire a ""super secret technology"", except that technology was an everyday thing in pre-war america in the games (and also in the show, but they just ignore it for some reason) and was one of the most significant technologies in human history and so it being a driving force for the plot doesn't make sense.",D,1/25/2025

rw10283812,tt20215234,Conclave (2024),"Sinopse:nCONCLAVE acompanha um dos eventos mais secretos e antigos do mundo: a escolha de um novo Papa. Após a morte inesperada do atual pontífice, o Cardeal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) é encarregado de conduzir esse processo confidencial. Os líderes mais poderosos da Igreja Católica de todo o mundo se reúnem nos corredores do Vaticano para participar da seleção, cada um com suas próprias ambições. Lawrence se vê no centro de uma conspiração, desvendando segredos que ameaçam não apenas sua fé, mas também as fundações da Igreja.nnCrítica:n""Conclave"", dirigido por Edward Berger e adaptado do romance de Robert Harris, é uma obra que provoca reflexão enquanto explora os recantos sombrios e intricados da escolha do próximo papa. Com um elenco estelar liderado por Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Sergio Castellitto e Isabella Rossellini, o filme aproveita seu potencial dramático para pintar um retrato envolvente do poder, da ambição e da fé.nnA narrativa se desenrola em meio à atmosfera tensa do Vaticano, onde os cardeais se reúnem para eleger seu novo líder. Fiennes brilha como o cardeal Thomas Lawrence, que, ao mesmo tempo em que é um homem de fé, se vê enredado em um jogo político profundo e traiçoeiro. O filme habilmente mostra os conflitos internos de Lawrence, balançando entre a tradição e os escândalos que reverberam entre os candidatos. Isso não só mantém o espectador intrigado, mas também levanta perguntas pertinentes sobre a moralidade e a transparência dentro de uma instituição tão venerada.nnBerger, conhecido por sua habilidade em construir narrativas tensas, utiliza os corredores do Vaticano como um microcosmo para discutir temas universais de liderança e corrupção. A cinematografia é rica em detalhes, capturando a grandiosidade e a claustrofobia do ambiente vaticano. A trilha sonora, sutil mas impactante, complementa a construção de tensão, elevando momentos cruciais da trama.nnOs diálogos, escritos por Peter Straughan, são afiados e reveladores, revelando as motivações pessoais dos cardeais e suas interações complexas, cheias de alianças e rivalidades. Isso transforma o filme em um verdadeiro drama psicológico, onde cada decisão é uma dança cuidadosa entre obrigações e interesses pessoais.nn""Conclave"" não se limita a ser um thriller político; é uma exploração profunda da fé, do poder e da humanidade inerente em cada um. Ao desenrolar um enredo que mantém o espectador à beira do assento, o filme provoca reflexões sobre até onde os indivíduos irão por sua crença e os pesos das decisões que moldam o futuro de milhões.nnEm suma, ""Conclave"" é uma adição notável ao gênero, que combina excelência dramática com questionamentos filosóficos, fazendo-o não apenas um entretenimento, mas uma reflexão essencial para o público moderno.",D,1/25/2025

Shadow only cares about being the coolest person in the room, so he will keep making stuff up as long as it makes him seem so (even though he accidentally ends up being correct!).nnPlot (9/10)nThe protag has a simple yet twisted goal, he wants to be a normal-looking guy who is actually an eminence in shadow ie his alter ego is basically the strongest person although his named self is the normiest of normies.

However, the film fails miserably in almost every aspect, making it a disappointment on many levels.nnLack of Historical Accuracy: One of the film's most glaring issues is its complete disregard for historical accuracy. There appears to be zero research into the events of 1971 and 1975, with the narrative taking several creative liberties that distort the truth. Rather than being an insightful retelling of history, the film feels like a shallow attempt to sensationalize pivotal moments without any depth or understanding.nnControversial and Insulting Portrayals: The movie crosses the line with its disrespectful portrayal of significant figures like Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi. The depiction of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is particularly offensive, undermining the legacy of a leader who played a crucial role in the history of Bangladesh. Similarly, the portrayal of Indira Gandhi comes across as insulting and reductive, failing to capture her complexities as a leader and a person.nnTechnical Shortcomings: The makeup and prosthetics, which should have been a highlight in a biopic, are poorly executed. The attempt to transform Kangana Ranaut into Indira Gandhi is laughable at best, with inconsistent visuals that break the immersion.nnPerformances: The acting across the board is subpar. Even with a talented ensemble cast, the performances feel uninspired, and Kangana Ranaut's portrayal of Indira Gandhi lacks the gravitas and emotional nuance required for such a role.nnDirection and Execution: The direction is one of the weakest aspects of the film.

rw10283348,tt27378311,Dead Lover (2025),"At the Sundance Film Festival last night, I witnessed the bizarre, hilarious, and utterly singular Dead Lover-a movie so unabashedly weird it feels like the acid trip of an art-house Dr. Frankenstein. This is unlike anything you have seen before. Directed, co-written, and starring Grace Glowicki, Dead Lover is a bold experiment in art-house filmmaking that blends influences from Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and even the slapstick insanity of Looney Tunes. Before the screening, I spoke briefly with Glowicki, who emphasized that this was a deeply collaborative effort between the four actors in the cast. It's evident that this was a passion project, crafted with love and chaos. It's a film for anyone who identifies as a freak, oddball, weirdo, or outcast, and I'm all about that vibe. We need more movies embracing comedic necrophilia!nnThe story follows a Gravedigger, played by Glowicki, whose constant stench of rotting flesh has made her love life, well, difficult. She dreams of finding a lover, but has all but given up. That is, until she meets a poet (Ben Petrie) who not only tolerates her unique aroma but adores it. Their romance is intense and short-lived-he dies in a shipwreck, leaving her only his finger and the ring she gave him. What follows is a surreal quest as the Gravedigger tries to restore her lover's body through botanical and electrical means. Beyond that, it's almost impossible to describe the plot-or even the experience-of watching Dead Lover.nnThe film feels like a psychedelic fever dream. It's shot entirely on glorious 16mm film, with minimal sets, stark black backgrounds, and a theatrical quality. I kept thinking this could be a stage production, but that would never capture its cinematic energy. The visuals are a dizzying assault of color, complemented by frantic editing, kaleidoscopic lighting, and a wonderfully eccentric score by U. S. Girls. The minimalism of the set design places the focus squarely on the cartoonishly exaggerated performances.nnAt its heart, Dead Lover is a comedy that revels in the absurd and dark freakishness. Glowicki's character anchors the madness, but the other three cast members-Ben Petrie, Leah Doz, and Lowen Morrow-play multiple roles, evoking the sketch-comedy energy of Monty Python. Some jokes land beautifully; others don't quite stick, but the barrage of sound, color, and chaos kept the film moving forward with my eyes glued to the screen wondering what boundaries would be crossed next. There's a sense of creative, artistic freedom in every scene, a willingness to take risks and lean into the transgressive. Horror and comedy both work best when they dare to push the buttons of their audience.nnLowen Morrow, in particular, brings an undeniable stage presence to their various characters. Their energy is magnetic, funny, and you can sense the joy they bring to every part. Watching the cast embody so many different personas with such enthusiasm is one of the film's highlights. I really want to see this troupe collab on another movie.nnThat said, Dead Lover does lose some of its momentum in the second half. The film's premiere audience was engaged and laughing through much of the first half, but by the second, the theater grew quieter. It seemed like the manic energy of the comedy started to run out of steam, and the plot became more disjointed. With so many characters and scenarios to keep track of, I found myself losing sight of the story's core.nnThere's pedigree here, though. Rocky Horror Picture Show (holy crap...its 50th anniversary is this year) is the cult classic to end all cult classics, but every time I see it - usually at a midnight screening - I'm reminded how front-loaded it is. All the catchiest tunes and energy are in that first 45 minutes.nnStill, this isn't a movie meant to be scrutinized for its deep, soul-searching storyline. The joy of Dead Lover lies in its unfiltered, madcap creativity. It's the kind of film that demands to be seen with a crowd, preferably at midnight with half the audience drunk and the other half on edibles. It's destined to become a cult favorite-an anarchic, art-house, transgressive experience, perfect for midnight screenings and party viewings. Watch it with your chosen mutant family.nnWhile it's not my favorite film of the festival, I deeply admired the passion and commitment of everyone involved. The sheer originality of Dead Lover is undeniable, and it's a testament to what can happen when a group of artists is given the freedom to create something completely outside the box. Despite its flaws, I'm eager to revisit the film. It feels like the kind of movie that might grow on me with time.nnIf you're a creative soul, an artist, or just willing to embrace the madness, Dead Lover is a singular experience that defies comparison. Go into it with an open mind, embrace the bonkers energy, and just let it happen. And edibles might not hurt.nnRead all my reviews at ShadeStudios.com.",D,1/25/2025

rw10283273,tt18259086,Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024),"DELETE: First, I want to start by giving immense kudos to the director and the studio for their willingness to listen to fan feedback and improve upon their trilogy. This kind of thoughtful response and commitment to delivering something fans truly love is rare in the industry, and it shows in the final product. Without a doubt, this movie is the best of the trilogy. Every element-from the cast to the story to the fan service-comes together in a way that feels both exciting and deeply satisfying.nnThe cast deserves high praise. Keanu Reeves as Shadow is an inspired choice, and he brings the character to life in a way that feels true to his essence while adding his signature depth and charisma. Idris Elba as Knuckles continues to shine, delivering a performance that is both strong and humorous. And then there's Jim Carrey, who delivers not one, but two incredible performances as dual versions of Robotnik. His portrayal is nothing short of spectacular, and he completely owns every scene he's in. The energy, humor, and emotional depth he brings make his performance unforgettable. I genuinely hope they bring him back for a fourth movie because what he accomplishes here is remarkable. There's a moment near the end of the film where he delivered such a heartfelt performance that it brought a few tears to my eyes-something I wasn't expecting in a movie like this.nnOne of the standout aspects of the film is its dedication to honoring the source material. The sheer number of references packed into this movie is amazing. From video game Easter eggs to pop culture nods, the film is a treasure trove for fans. They clearly put in the effort to pay homage to iconic scenes from the Sonic games, and the result is a movie that feels like a love letter to the franchise. For any Sonic fan, this is as close to heaven as it gets. The jokes and clever callbacks not only bring laughs but also show how much care and thought went into making this film. It's clear the creators understand and respect what makes Sonic special.nnThe story itself is engaging and fun, taking viewers on a thrilling ride from start to finish. It's the kind of movie that leaves you smiling, entertained, and excited for what's next. James Marsden and Tika Sumpter also deserve recognition for their excellent work. Acting alongside animated characters is no easy feat, but they make it look effortless. Their performances are believable and heartfelt, grounding the story and helping the audience stay connected to the narrative. Their chemistry and commitment add a layer of authenticity that elevates the entire film.nnThis movie is a shining example of how listening to fans can transform a project for the better. The studio and creators took the feedback they received and implemented it in a way that not only satisfied fans but elevated the overall quality of the trilogy. Other studios could learn a lot from this approach. When you respect your audience and give them what they love, the result speaks for itself.nnOverall, I give this movie an 8/10. It's an absolute blast, and I highly recommend it to anyone, whether they're longtime Sonic fans or just looking for a fun and heartfelt experience. You won't be disappointed!",D,1/25/2025

The posh accents and wooden dialogue ruined the whole character of the movie. I stopped and watched in German and it was much better.nn""The Calendar Killer"" delivers a tense and chilling thriller that effectively explores the psychological impact of domestic abuse. The film masterfully builds suspense, leaving the audience constantly on edge as Klara's paranoia escalates. The performances are strong, particularly Luise Heyer as Klara, who portrays her character's fear and desperation with raw intensity.nnHowever, the film's reliance on familiar thriller tropes and predictable twists can diminish its impact. The pacing occasionally falters, and some plot points feel contrived.

O filme se estrutura no expressionismo de uma forma extremamente atual, e até mesmo, honesta pros primórdios dele. O expressionismo se caracteriza pela subjetividade da realidade, focando mais na parte metafórica daquilo que é real, mas aqui, se foca na realidade metafórica que vivemos; fazendo algo certamente contraditório em usar a realidade como terror no expressionismo.

O movimento suave das câmeras e a direção precisa criam uma atmosfera hipnótica que envolve o espectador do início ao fim. A direção de arte e a fotografia são impecáveis, capturando a essência do expressionismo alemão e evocando claramente influências de obras cinematográficas das décadas de 1920 e 1930.nnA estética do filme presta homenagem aos primórdios do cinema, com sequências que remetem às montagens de Georges Méliès, pioneiro do cinema fantástico. Além disso, Eggers revisita elementos dos filmes de terror da era do cinema mudo, utilizando enquadramentos e técnicas que evocam a atmosfera sombria e inquietante característica desse período.nnA atuação de Bill Skarsgård como Conde Orlok é digna de destaque. Sua interpretação traz uma presença ameaçadora e enigmática, capturando a essência do vampiro clássico enquanto adiciona camadas de profundidade ao personagem.nnEm suma, Nosferatu (2024) oferece um olhar clássico para um conto de terror atemporal, reinterpretado através de uma abordagem visual inovadora e profundamente respeitosa às suas origens.

Agora criam tudo em computação e na maioria das vezes parece um boneco de playstation 2. E nesse filme é tudo CGI, tem uma cena que o vilão solta a gaiola que tem três cachorros para que desçam do carro, ELES USAM CGI PRA BOTAR TRÊS CACHORROS DESCENDO DO CARRO!!!!!!!!!!! Não é possível que não exista três cachorros semelhantes que pudessem fazer essa simples e fácil ação, descer do carro. O CGI do fogo que sai após cada disparo de arma de fogo também beira o ridículo, onde estão as balas de festim ?nnOutra coisa que incomodou demais é que tudo era fundo verde, um fundo verde barato e grosseiramente notado em varias cenas, me atrevo a dizer que nenhum dos atores principais se quer entraram em um veiculo em todo o filme. Até lugar fechado tinha tela verde amigo.nnOutra coisa Mad Max pra mim foi marcante pelo fator Carros extravagantes, nesse filme se tem 2 carros é muita coisa. Aparece o lendário V8 do Max e um caminhão chinfrin do vilão. A maioria das perseguições são com motos, sinceramente não tem o mesmo efeito, quem ai não fala de Mad Max e já pensa naquele carro com caixas de som e um guitarrista preso cuspindo fogo da sua guitarra? (Esse que inclusive aparece em segundos numa cena do filme) e ai desse veículo incrível, eles desceram pra motos normais, uma máquina de guerra e sónTaylor Joy sempre com sua falta de expressividade, sempre de cara séria e fechada (ok poderia ser pq a Furiosa esteja sempre assim) mas na batalha final ela literalmente tem o braço esmagado quando o carro do vilão bate na lateral do carro dela, e mesmo assim ela mantém a cara fechada e cheia de furia. Po amigo desculpa, mas se tenho meu braço triturado quase arrancado fora, eu estaria ao menos gritando e sofrendo de dor.nnThor não combina com vilão, não tem jeito pra vilão, não tem cara de vilão e durante várias cenas me arrancou uma risada, que tipo de vilão é esse que arranca risadas?nnOutra coisa que incomoda também é o fator burrice dos personagens, na infância a mãe da furiosa resgata ela, vai lutar com 100 capangas para que tal furiosa consiga fugir, a criança na cena seguinte volta tudo correndo pra ver a mãe sendo queimada e logo é capturada. Imagino a mente da mãe quando viu a filha se aproximar ""Que criança burra!!!"" mas isso dá pra passar por ser criança mas enfim incomodou a burrice da mesma.nnEnfim, tantos defeitos que acabaram escondendo as qualidades que eu não saberia citar aqui, filme fraquíssimo.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282930,tt21279420,Emergency (2025),"Kangana Ranaut delivers a gripping tale of resilience, power, and redemption in her latest directorial venture, Emergency. The film, based on the turbulent period of the Indian Emergency from 1975 to 1977, is an unflinching exploration of one of India's most controversial political chapters. Combining powerful storytelling, stellar acting, and breathtaking cinematography, Emergency emerges as a cinematic masterpiece.nnKangana Ranaut not only plays the central role of Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, but also directs the film with remarkable finesse. Her portrayal of Mrs. Gandhi is nothing short of transformative. She captures the complexities of the leader with subtlety-balancing her commanding presence, calculated decisions, and moments of vulnerability. Ranaut's ability to humanize such a polarizing figure is one of the film's greatest achievements.nnThe story delves deep into the chaos and emotional upheaval caused by the Emergency, shedding light on the personal and political struggles of the era. It showcases the lives of ordinary citizens, journalists, opposition leaders, and bureaucrats caught in the whirlwind of political oppression. The narrative is both gripping and thought-provoking, painting a vivid picture of how power can be both a unifying force and a destructive weapon.nnThe supporting cast deserves special mention. Actors like Anupam Kher, Satish Kaushik, and Milind Soman deliver memorable performances that add depth to the narrative. Their characters, though distinct, come together seamlessly to portray the multifaceted impact of the Emergency. Anupam Kher, in particular, stands out with his powerful depiction of Jayaprakash Narayan, a leader of the opposition who becomes the voice of dissent.nnWhat sets Emergency apart is its cinematography. The film's visuals are striking, with a careful interplay of light and shadow that reflects the oppressive atmosphere of the time. The attention to detail in recreating the 1970s-from costumes and set design to the cultural and political landscape-is commendable. The use of archival footage and historical references adds authenticity to the storytelling, making it both engaging and educational.nnThe music and background score complement the film's tone perfectly. The haunting melodies and evocative soundscapes heighten the emotional impact of key scenes. Whether it's a poignant moment of loss or a fiery confrontation, the music amplifies the intensity without overshadowing the narrative.nnOne of the film's most significant strengths is its ability to spark reflection. It doesn't just narrate history but also raises questions about the balance between power and responsibility, the fragility of democracy, and the resilience of the human spirit. The film avoids outright glorification or vilification, instead offering a nuanced perspective that encourages viewers to think critically about the events and their relevance in today's socio-political context.nnHowever, Emergency is not without its flaws. At times, the pacing feels uneven, with certain sequences lingering longer than necessary. While this might have been intended to emphasize the gravity of the situations, it occasionally disrupts the narrative flow. Additionally, some characters could have been fleshed out further to create a more cohesive emotional connection.nnDespite these minor shortcomings, Emergency is a powerful cinematic achievement. Kangana Ranaut's fearless direction and outstanding performance anchor the film, making it a compelling watch. The film succeeds in balancing entertainment with substance, ensuring that audiences are both moved and informed.nnEmergency is more than just a historical drama; it is a mirror to society, a reminder of the cost of freedom, and a tribute to the resilience of those who stood up for justice during one of India's darkest periods. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, urging you to revisit history and reflect on its lessons.nnIn conclusion, Emergency is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates powerful storytelling, stellar performances, and thought-provoking cinema. Kangana Ranaut has once again proven her mettle as an artist and filmmaker, cementing her position as one of the most fearless voices in Indian cinema. Emergency is a bold, evocative, and unforgettable film that deserves to be experienced on the big screen.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282838,tt21192142,All of Us Strangers (2023),"Sinopse:nUma noite em seu prédio quase vazio em Londres, Adam tem um encontro casual com seu misterioso vizinho Harry, o que acaba abalando o ritmo de sua vida cotidiana.nnCrítica:n""Todos Nós Desconhecidos"", dirigido por Andrew Haigh, apresenta uma exploração sensível e introspectiva das conexões humanas. Situado em um prédio quase vazio em Londres, o filme combina um enredo simples com uma profundidade emocional notável, centrando-se no encontro casual entre Adam e seu enigmático vizinho Harry.nnA atuação se destaca, pois ambos os atores conseguem transmitir a complexidade de seus personagens com sutileza. Adam, um homem preso em sua rotina, acaba confrontando seus medos e inseguranças através da aventura inesperada com Harry. O encontro entre os dois se transforma em uma jornada de autodescoberta, trazendo à tona questões sobre solidão, pertencimento e a busca por conexões significativas em meio ao isolamento urbano.nnA cinematografia é outro ponto forte. Haigh utiliza a atmosfera do prédio e as ruas de Londres de maneira a refletir o estado emocional dos personagens. A iluminação e os ângulos de câmera são cuidadosamente escolhidos, criando uma ambientação que dá suporte à narrativa, tornando a cidade uma extensão das experiências de Adam e Harry.nnNo entanto, o filme pode parecer arrastado para alguns, com momentos de contemplação que exigem paciência do espectador. A narrativa, embora rica em nuances, pode carecer de um clímax mais impactante, o que pode desagradar aqueles que buscam uma trama mais dinâmica. Além disso, a falta de desenvolvimento de alguns personagens secundários pode deixar o espectador desejando mais profundidade.nnEm suma, ""Todos Nós Desconhecidos"" se destaca como uma reflexão poética sobre a fragilidade das relações humanas em um mundo moderno e muitas vezes solitário. Apesar de seus pequenos empecilhos, o filme oferece uma visão tocante sobre momentos de conexão, revelando a beleza e a dor de sermos, ao mesmo tempo, desconhecidos e interligados. É uma obra que merece ser vista, especialmente por aqueles que apreciam histórias que valorizam o silêncio e a quietude na busca por compreensão e pertencimento.",D,1/25/2025
rw10282826,tt16539454,Pushpa: The Rule - Part 2 (2024),"Pushpa 2 has generated immense hype, but it seems tailored for a specific audience drawn to exaggerated and over-the-top storytelling. The scene where the protagonist interrupts a significant moment, like a meeting, to engage in an intimate act in the kitchen, starting by kissing the heroine's foot, feels unnecessarily dramatic and outlandish. Such sequences might appeal to certain viewers but fail to resonate with others who prefer more grounded storytelling.nnSimilarly, the portrayal of the protagonist as an invincible, larger-than-life figure, indulging in random, extreme acts of rebellion or romance, might come across as cringeworthy or overly sensational. The film's tendency to glorify toxic traits under the guise of machismo could alienate a segment of the audience.nnWhile the movie thrives on its raw energy and mass appeal, these elements might deter viewers who value nuanced plots and realistic character development.",D,1/25/2025
rw10282814,tt14833612,"""Castlevania: Nocturne"" (2023)","This show is absolutely amazing! And all the negative reviews were 100% made by TRUMP SUPPORTERS. The thing about Trump supporters is that they'll never admit the real reason they are leaving negative reviews. Instead, they'll point to something else like the shows ""storyline"", claim the ""villains"" suck or point to literally anything they can come up with to avoid actual saying the REAL reason for their negative review. But no need to fear! I'll do it for them.nnThe real reason for the negative reviews are simply that these Trump supporters are triggered that majority of the characters in this show are minorities. The same people who are saying the show sucked, would be the same people cheering about how amazing the show is if all the characters were simply made white, it's not the show they hate, it's the skin color of the characters they hate.nnThis version of Castlevania is set in a time period where minorities were going through situations like slavery, so it's not a shocker that slavery is an obstacle these characters would have to deal with.nnI think it's absolutely awesome that Netflix created this version of Castlevania where the characters are minorities and they face realistic minority problems (slavery) from that time period. Unlike Trump supporters, Netflix didn't try hide reality, pretend that slavery never happened or get triggered at the topic of slavery for making white people look bad.nnThis show is phenomenal, watch it and see for yourself instead of listening to the negative reviews of Trump supporters who are enraged that the characters in the show aren't white.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282813,tt27056066,Sky Force (2025),Skyforce directed by the duo of Sandeep Kelwani and Abhishek Anil Kapur is set during the hugely tumulus war of 1965. The movie follows the events of the successful air strike where a squadron leader goes missing. This squadron leader is portrayed by the promising Veer Pahariya. On the other hand Akshay Kumar plays a wing commander cum fatherly figure. The relentless quest of Akshay Kumar's KO Ahuja in bringing a closure to his fellow men and also the wife played by Sara Ali Khan gives the movie some of its best moments. Sharad Kelkar playing Pakistani squadron leader Ahmed Hussain plays a key role in solving this mystery. The interactions between Akshay Kumar and Sharad Kelkar exploring a mutual respect for the men in the uniform across nations is also a delight to watch.

No disrespect for the rest of the cast. Michelle Yeoh does a fine job on building on the character of Emperor Philippe Georgio. Two other innovative ideas in the cast are Omari Hardwick, who plays special ops team leader Alok, who is an Augment survivor of the Eugenics Wars, as well as Kacey Rohl, who plays young Rachel Garrett, the future captain of the Enterprise-C. Unfortunately these two characters make up the only two compelling characters of the entire cast.nnA missing member of the cast is Star Fleet, which is simply put underrepresented. A token appearance of a Constitution Class starship would have propped up an otherwise bland plot.nnOverall the movie is still ""OK"", but it has more the feel of a two-episode story from an ongoing series instead of a stand alone movie.

rw10282440,tt26656917,"""The Agency"" (2024)","The casting choices in this production are a significant point of concern, particularly the portrayal of Iranian characters. It's frustrating to see the continued reliance on a generic ""brown guy"" approach to casting, rather than prioritizing authenticity and cultural accuracy. This practice not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also undermines the credibility of the narrative.nnImagine casting a Latvian actor to portray an American character. Even if the actor is talented, the subtle nuances of American culture, accent, body language, and references would likely be missed or misrepresented. This lack of authenticity would create a jarring disconnect for the audience, hindering their ability to fully immerse themselves in the story. This is precisely the issue with the casting choices in question. The actors, while perhaps capable performers in other roles, lack the specific cultural background and understanding necessary to convincingly portray Iranian characters. This results in a performance that feels inauthentic and stereotypical, relying on broad generalizations rather than genuine cultural representation.nnThis isn't simply a matter of nitpicking. In 2025, audiences expect and deserve better. We live in an increasingly interconnected world, and media has a responsibility to portray diverse cultures with sensitivity and accuracy. The lazy approach of casting any actor with a vaguely similar skin tone is not only disrespectful to the Iranian community but also a disservice to the art of storytelling. It reduces complex cultural identities to simplistic caricatures, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and hindering genuine cross-cultural understanding.nnFurthermore, this type of casting suggests a lack of effort and research on the part of the production team. It implies a disregard for the richness and complexity of Iranian culture, reducing it to a superficial collection of tropes. This is unacceptable in today's media landscape, where resources and expertise are readily available to ensure accurate and respectful representation. Consultants, cultural advisors, and actors with the appropriate cultural background should be actively sought out to ensure authenticity.nnThe failure to prioritize authentic casting detracts significantly from the overall viewing experience. It creates a sense of disconnect and inauthenticity that undermines the narrative. Instead of engaging with the story and characters, the audience is constantly reminded of the artificiality of the portrayal. This ultimately diminishes the impact of the production and reinforces harmful stereotypes. In 2025, it's crucial that productions prioritize authentic casting and cultural sensitivity to create more engaging, respectful, and ultimately more meaningful stories. This production falls short of that standard and needs to do better.",D,1/25/2025

While some comedic moments land, many are out of place, which can detract from the film's more serious undertones.nnThe Verdict:nnThis movie isn't the epic send-off the DCEU might have deserved, but it does manage to be entertaining in its own right. If you can turn your brain off and dive into the spectacle, there's fun to be had here. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a decent, if flawed, conclusion that leaves you wishing for what could have been.

rw10282378,tt0101921,Fried Green Tomatoes (1991),"""Evelyn"" (Kathy Bates) and her husband ""Ed"" (Gailard Sartain) are going through the motions in their marriage. They've long stopped making any effort for each other and she is a bit fed up. It's when she is visiting a friend at an old folk's home that she encounters the frail but spritely ""Ninny"" (Jessica Tandy) and they get chatting. The older lady starts to regale her with stories of her younger wife in rural Alabama and of her sister-in-law ""Idgie"" (Mary Stuart Masterson). Over the next couple of weeks and months ""Evelyn"" becomes addicted to hearing the stories, as do we, of racial and sexual inequality, iniquity and joy as this small subsistence community slowly and sometimes brutally evolves. The effects of this retrospective are quite profound on the younger lady who starts to feel empowered by what she's hearing. Her confidence grows - even if her insurance premiums start to go up - and she begins to take steps to improve her domestic situation. The photography and the engagingly crafted script illustrate quite powerfully and affectionately the struggles of just about everyone in a 1920s where racism and bigotry were never far away; the KKK travelled thrived unfettered and any sort of inter-racial relationship was downright dangerous. There are also strong contributions from Mary-Louise Parker as the upstanding, preacher's daughter, ""Ruth"" and from Stan Shaw as ""Big George"" as the thrust of inspiration in the face of adversity is transferred onto life in the 1990s. Tandy and Bates prove the perfect pairing as they mix the good and the bad, the happy and the sad and a fair degree of good old fashioned common sense and stoicism to create rounded and plausible characters, a degree of nostalgia and loads of mischief. It is slightly rose-tinted, but it's still well worth a look see an ensemble cast at it's best.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282371,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"Really thought this movie was going to suck so bad based what I've seen on Twitter, but I genuinely enjoyed it. Don't understand why so many people are pissed about the best picture nomination when, in the previous years, you have shit like Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody (to name a few) nominated for Best Picture which were significantly worse than this. Not really sure if it's just transphobic people hating on this or that people have only seen certain scenes out of context that generated the hate for this film, but I thought it was solid.nnThe vaginoplastia song was kinda goofy but there are a lot of songs that are actual foot stomping bangers too. My main complaint about the songs is that the transition into song and dance sometimes feel like they erupt out of nowhere, but when the incredible cinematography and choreography starts happening, who gives a fuck? There's also this one song in the middle of the film from the son about how Emilia smells like his ""papa"", which was an amazing scene and was genuinely emotional. I'm glad to see Gascon getting nominated for best actress (first trans nominee!) as she gives an amazing performance despite some questionable writing when it came to the character of Emilia.nnThe pacing of the film does start to drag on a bit. Things just seem to happen for the sake of happening and the transition from scene to scene felt awkward and unwarranted. The ending also felt a little rushed and I wish there was more of a conclusion.nnThere might be some valid criticisms regarding the portrayal of Mexican culture and I'm not well-equipped to tackle that as an Asian dude who has never been to or experienced Mexico.

rw10282341,tt9663764,Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),"""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" serves as a colorful, action-packed finale to the DC Extended Universe, though it's not without its hiccups.nnThe Good:nnPatrick Wilson shines as Orm, bringing depth to the brotherly dynamic with Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry. Their chemistry is one of the film's highlights, making the moments they share some of the most enjoyable.nnThe visual spectacle is undeniable. It delivers stunning underwater sequences, with water simulations that are a visual feast. The action scenes, particularly the epic trident clash, are well-executed and genuinely thrilling.nnThe movie has a fun, cartoonish vibe that embraces the comic book source material, offering a light-hearted escape which some might argue is exactly what a superhero film should be.nnThe Bad:nnThe plot feels disjointed, possibly due to heavy studio meddling and visible reshoots. This disrupts the narrative flow and leaves some character arcs feeling rushed or underdeveloped.nnAmber Heard's role as Mera is contentious, with many feeling her presence was more of a distraction due to off-screen controversies rather than adding to the story.nnThe humor often feels forced. While some comedic moments land, many are out of place, which can detract from the film's more serious undertones.nnThe Verdict:nnThis movie isn't the epic send-off the DCEU might have deserved, but it does manage to be entertaining in its own right. If you can turn your brain off and dive into the spectacle, there's fun to be had here. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a decent, if flawed, conclusion that leaves you wishing for what could have been. Fans of the first ""Aquaman"" might find it a step down, but there's enough here for a good time at the movies, especially with the right expectations.nnIn the end, ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" is like a vibrant, action-packed comic book come to life, but it's bogged down by studio decisions that prevent it from reaching its full potential. Still, for those looking for a fun, if not particularly deep, superhero adventure, this film delivers just enough to be worth a watch.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282243,tt0108555,When the Bough Breaks (1994),"When the Bough Breaks has the ingredients for being a solid, memorable movie, but even with Ally Walker who plays a good role as the special agent investigating, the story doesn't rise as we hope for and expect, resulting in a disappointing outcome.nnAudrey Mcleah is the appointed investigator to solve and bring a child murderer to justice, because the cops in the locale are too busy drinking coffee and talking sh*t all the time. Martin Sheen as the Tommy Lee Jones wannabe, Captain Swaggert (no relation to Jimmy as far as Iam aware), along with his team of deadheads are the understandable reason for McLeah being asked to cover for them and help them look good and/or being capable of holding their jobs. McLeah as the somewhat rebellious, mouth-dangling cigarette character, is likeable and endearing, showing both a rough edge and a caring side, particularly toward the kid with visions, Jordan Thomas played by Tara Subkoff. Their interactions are the movie's greatest aspect amid a muddled story and slow progression. Dubbed a thriller, this takes a long time to show signs of meeting that tag and towards the end things do get a bit more 'thrilling' and exciting but the lead up to it, after the well set up introduction, super drags on in collaboration with Walker's incessant cigarette draws and I get the feeling they really wanted this to have a gritty, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Carol Kane, Anthony Hopkins mosaic look and feel, but even though it's not a bad effort, they should have done more with this movie.nnI really wanted to give this a 6 because Ally Walker is good to watch here, but they just didn't bring it home the way they should have. After the good start I was left feeling underwhelmed with the uninspired and disinterested approach to expanding and lifting the pace and at the end I wasn't able to go higher than 5.

rw10282231,tt8368368,The Apprentice (2024),"On the outside looking in, The Apprentice is the story of the rise of Donald Trump and his real estate business empire. It's also a behind the scenes look at longtime friends Roy Cohn and Donald J. Trump from the 1970s until 1986. The film showcases the story of both men in a provocative, yet humanizing and intriguing way, with love and sometimes hate towards one another. Cohn had been a prosecutor long before he met and became a mentor to Trump. It was fascinating to learn that Cohn was involved with the Rosenbergs trial and prosecution.nnThere are scenes in the film that can seem biased against Trump, and even caused Donald Trump himself to try and stop the release of the film, albeit unsuccessfully. One of those scenes involves Donald and his first wife Ivana being intimate, but the context was taken directly from first hand testimony from Ivana Trump herself when she divorced Donald. The second half of the film deals with the AIDS epidemic during the early 1980s, which was a scare to everyone because no one knew anything about it; and just the admittance of having AIDS was a social death sentence.nnI myself am not sure how Trump reacted to the AIDS epidemic, this was most likely dramatized for the film; especially when it came to the fact that Roy Cohn vehemently denied contracting the disease, but later died having been fighting it until his death. I do wonder if there will be a sequel to this film, bringing to light the next chapter of Trump's life. It'd be interesting to see, at least in a historic basis.",D,1/25/2025

rw10282183,tt22022452,Inside Out 2 (2024),"Inside Out 2 introduces new, more complicated emotions as Riley becomes a teenager. And suddenly the ""Puberty"" button goes off.nnFirst out is Anxiety, a hyperactive over-planner who is trying to help but ends up making things much worse. Much like anxiety in real life, she never lets you slow down or sleep.nnNext is Envy, which they don't develop except on a bare-bones level. Maybe that is because all of us know what envy is. But small kids won't get it. Liking someone's hair or outfit is not true envy. True envy is a dangerous thing. But that is an article for another time.nnThe third new emotion is Embarrassment. This emotion they did so well. He is exactly how my embarrassment feels. He wears a large hoodie and hides inside it most of the time. In one scene Riley is so embarrassed that Embarassmet gives up pushing buttons and just lays on the control console. It was hilarious!nnAnd our last new emotion is Ennui, pronounced: ""On-U-E"". They call her ""the boredom"" but she looks more like an Emo spaghetti noodle. I don't like how they did this emotion. They barely explained what it was and then gave it little attention. I left with the impression this was more a self-defense mechanism and less an emotion.nnInside Out 2 also opens the door for a sequel by giving us a few glimpses of the emotion of Nostalgia. She is shown as an old lady but has a few very witty moments where she wanders into the room.nnBELIEF SYSTEM -Sadness and Joy explore the Belief System © 2024 Disney/Pixar. All Rights Reserved.nnAnother item Inside Out 2 introduces is Reily's Belief System. It forms a beautiful tree and its roots are various memories that make Reily who she is. The film used random experiences as the nutrition that created the roots of the belief system. In the end, they stopped being selective with which memories went into the soup. I have some issues with this whole idea.nnI disagree with their assessment that our belief system is formed only by random life experiences. The examples we are shown, the families we are raised in, and the communities we are a part of, all add to how we see ourselves. Along with that is an innate knowledge that we are something more than what we see in the mirror.nnFor example, I have always known that God is guiding me. There is just a feeling inside my heart that tells me so. And that is not something they can show in this movie. In trying to appeal to broad audiences they oversimplified the belief system.nnAnxiety Taking ControlnnAs the movie progresses Anxiety takes over. She bottles up the ""old"" emotions and drives Riley's life off a cliff. I recognized all her tricks as my anxiety has played the same ones on me. Feeling like you have to control everything, working myself into exhaustion, imagining all the awful things that can happen; that was my daily playlist for a long time.nnWHAT IS HAPPENING? - The Puberty Button goes off. © 2023 Disney/Pixar. All Rights Reserved.nnInside Out 2 does a great job showing all that anxiety does to sabotage you. What it doesn't do is give you real coping skills, and real ideas on how to get control of your anxiety. That is where the Skylight.org app has come into play in my life.nnIt is an amazing FREE app that guides you in dealing with anxiety, stress, overwhelm, and guides you to God. It's non-denominational, and I find peace in every exercise. Truly the Skylight app should be how Reily deals with her emotions because the writer failed to give any definitive answers in that category.nnSkylight is a spiritual wellness platform that integrates mental wellness strategies like meditation, yoga, and prayer with spiritual practices. It aims to aid individuals (specifically GenZennials aged 18-35) dealing with anxiety, stress, and other emotional challenges through a spiritual lens. Given the thematic relevance, Skylight seeks to raise awareness of how belief systems can play a critical role in managing mental health issues.nnSince discovering it, I have used the Skylight app often. I have even texted it to many on my contact list. It's truly an amazing tool and I highly recommend it. I especially love the affirmations to help with political stress. I will likely memorize them all by the time this presidential election is over. Its level-headed and Godly advice has helped me many times.nnMental Wellness/ Spiritual WellnessnnIn the movie the more anxiety Riley felt the further from her core values she drifted. She took greater risks and hurt the people she loved. I have found that my mental wellness is tied to my spiritual wellness. Like Riley when my mind isn't right my spirit isn't right either. Our bodies and minds are connected in ways we don't fully understand. And our minds and souls are connected in similar ways.nnJoy and Its Role In Our LivesnnThe final thought I have is about Joy. As a character, she is my favorite and is adorable. But in my life the only true source of joy is God. It's only in drawing that parallel that I can feel joy and peace, the two are inseparable. In the final scene where Reily is asking for Joy, she is truly saying a prayer and reaching for God. And Joy is the innocence and connection to God we all need.nnI liked Inside Out 2, they really got Anxiety right, but felt it ended too quickly. The characters needed to be fleshed out more. And the plot built up resolved far too fast for me. Even with that negative, I did like the movie. I liked how Anxiety seemed like an uncontrollable force until Joy stepped into the storm and saw her for what she was- frozen with fear.nnI liked the message about how we can overcome anxiety and not let it rule our lives. And I liked the few coping strategies they mentioned. I'd go see the movie and then download the Skylight app. It's the perfect finish to the story and lets you take the message of overcoming anxiety and apply it in real life.nnIf you are like me, and struggle with anxiety, don't wait to get support. The Skylight app is a safe and easy place to begin. But I have also found professional counseling helps. Sometimes you have to visit a couple of professionals before finding the right fit, but when you do it's amazing. This world of ours seems to feed anxieties and it is our challenge to overcome and stay focused on what matters. Good luck in your journey!",D,1/25/2025

The desperation and urgency are palpable, setting the stage for an epic quest to save humanity. What struck me immediately was the film's ability to blend grandiose science fiction with deeply personal storytelling.

rw10282111,tt0816692,Interstellar (2014),"This movie is undoubtedly one of the most visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and thought-provoking films of the 21st century. Released in 2014, it quickly established itself as a cinematic milestone, blending the finest elements of science fiction, human emotion, and innovative visual effects. From its breathtaking depiction of space to its deep exploration of love, time, and humanity's survival, Interstellar leaves a lasting impression on all who experience it.nnIt's essential to understand that Interstellar is more than just a space adventure. While it features awe-inspiring space travel, alien worlds, and wormholes, at its heart, it delves into human relationships, sacrifice, and our role in the universe. The story unfolds in a near-future Earth facing resource depletion and environmental collapse. Cooper, portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, is a former pilot turned farmer, living with his daughter Murphy (played by Mackenzie Foy and later Jessica Chastain). Their journey begins when they discover a hidden NASA facility, where they are enlisted for a mission to find a new home for humanity. The stakes are incredibly high, and as they venture into space, they embark on an emotional and intellectual journey through love, time, and the vastness of the cosmos.nnNolan's direction is precise, showcasing that the film is a true labor of love. His talent for building suspense, wonder, and emotional depth in every scene is nothing short of extraordinary. Interstellar is a genuine spectacle, but it's not just for the sake of spectacle.

rw10282046,tt21279420,Emergency (2025),"Kangana Ranaut's Emergency attempts to dramatize one of the most significant periods in Indian political history, but instead of offering a balanced or insightful perspective, the film spirals into historical inaccuracy and blatant propaganda. The portrayal of the Emergency era (1975-1977) under Indira Gandhi's government is heavily skewed, turning the narrative into a political vendetta rather than an honest recounting of events.nnOne of the most glaring issues in the film is its deliberate spread of misinformation about Bangladesh and its revered Father of the Nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The film irresponsibly distorts facts about the relationship between India and Bangladesh during that time, diminishing the role of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the country's liberation and post-independence development. Such misrepresentation is not only inappropriate but also deeply disrespectful to Bangladesh's history and legacy.nnThe movie is clearly politically motivated, serving as a vehicle for Kangana Ranaut's personal agenda rather than a historical account.

""Am I Racist"" is an incendiary and timely documentary that delves into the contradictions and hypocrisies of contemporary ""woke"" culture, offering an unflinching critique of how concepts like ESG and DEI are wielded in modern society.nnWhile undeniably provocative, the film is not without its flaws. It would have benefitted greatly from clearer introductions to the individuals it puts in the spotlight, as their credibility-or lack thereof-remains ambiguous throughout.

rw10281818,tt28459771,Oficina do Diabo (2025),"Filme bom, super recomendo que assistam pelo o motivo de que o filme retrata bem as ações diabólicas nas nossas vidas em diversos modos, nos tentando e querendo que nos afastemos de Deus. Então o filme mostra por uma perspectiva como o demônio nos tenta até mesmo na sutileza do dia a dia e mostrar isso é bom porque ficamos ainda mais atentos em nossa conduta cristã, repudiando ainda mais o pecado e até mesmo a ocasião próxima do pecado. Também é bom porque o desejo do inimigo é que nos esqueçamos que ele existe, como muitos vivem como se não tivessem uma alma para ser salva, ele gosta disso porque passa despercebido e, deste modo, não é combatido. Acho que contribui para ficar em vigilância e nos apegarmos a Cristo, repudiando o pecado. Sem dúvida, podem assistir.nnA cinematográfia é um fator muito bem explorado e harmonizado as trilhas sonoras e seus efeitos. O roteiro aparenta ser simples, mas consegue prender o telespectador de uma forma indescritível, é pura emoção. Amei a forma complexa e bem pensada que o filme aborda as narrativas, mesmo focando em apenas uma, sendo ela a vida de Pedro. Dá para ver que a relação de causa, consequência, moralidade e responsabilidade afetam todos aqueles que na trama incluem, sem exceção. É filme que cada capítulo te traz trinta reflexões (ou mais), em especial os últimos, os quais mais tiveram impacto na minha experiência. Uma outra que me chamou atenção é como o filme é trabalha os pequenos detalhes, principalmente, em relação as emoções que cada fragmento de narrativa se pede. As cenas que supostamente deveriam causar felicidade, é perceptível um sentimento de decadência e superficialidade, uma ""falsa alegria"", bem como o protagonista realmente sente. É barbaro ressaltar esse ponto e não comentar o momento em que o público tem conhecimento do passado da mãe, os flashes de informações e agoniam são absurdos, impactantes e incrivelmente necessários para a cena requisitada, juntando com outros eventos que também ocorriam. De forma rica, ""Oficina do Diabo"" nos ambientaliza com maestria a estética da época, tanto pela perspectiva internacional quanto nacional, é tudo muito lindo. Se comecei a achar, agora tenho certeza ao afirmar que é um filme necessário e que vale muitíssimo seu tempo, com risco de voltar em vários capítulos e ter novas reflexões. Muito obrigada pela experiência. Um orgulho ao cinema nacional.",D,1/25/2025

rw10281807,tt28607951,Anora (2024),"Após um hiato de três anos, Sean Baker retorna com Anora, uma obra que reafirma sua habilidade em explorar personagens marginalizados com profundidade e autenticidade. Conhecido por filmes como The Florida Project e Tangerine, Baker utiliza sua assinatura narrativa para capturar as nuances da humanidade, desafiando estereótipos e desconstruindo ideias preconcebidas. Desta vez, ele tem em mãos seu projeto mais ambicioso até então, com uma distribuição internacional robusta e um desempenho impecável de Mikey Madison, que entrega a atuação de sua carreira.nnBaker divide Anora em duas metades distintas, mas complementares, cada uma sustentando pilares narrativos que envolvem e surpreendem o espectador. Na primeira metade, o diretor nos apresenta à protagonista Anora, uma dançarina exótica cuja vida gira em torno das complexidades do trabalho sexual e da busca incessante pelo ""sonho americano"". Aqui, Baker mergulha na vivência de Anora com um olhar afetuoso, mas realista, equilibrando momentos de curtição desenfreada - regados a sexo, bebidas e festas - com uma sutil construção do dilema emocional que ela enfrenta. Essa parte inicial do filme é essencialmente uma ilusão, uma celebração fugaz antes que a narrativa exponha as consequências desse estilo de vida.nnA introdução de Ivan, um parceiro aparentemente encantador que oferece a Anora uma chance de viver esse sonho de forma despreocupada, adiciona camadas de ambiguidade à trama. A relação entre eles flutua entre o interesse financeiro e a possibilidade de um vínculo mais profundo, mantendo o público em constante expectativa. Baker também planta indícios sutis do que está por vir, preparando o terreno para uma transição dramática que marca a segunda metade do filme.nnQuando a virada ocorre, Anora transforma-se em uma montanha-russa emocional. O ritmo frenético ainda permanece, mas agora com uma narrativa mais introspectiva e dramática, expondo os impactos das escolhas feitas pelos personagens. Baker, no entanto, não se limita ao drama; ele mescla cenas carregadas de peso emocional com momentos de humor e leveza, criando uma experiência cinematográfica equilibrada. A habilidade do diretor em explorar temas sensíveis de forma acessível é um de seus maiores trunfos, e isso é amplificado pela fotografia naturalista de Drew Daniels, que captura os Estados Unidos com um realismo envolvente.nnO coração de Anora é, sem dúvida, Mikey Madison. Conhecida por seu papel em Era Uma Vez em Hollywood, Madison entrega uma performance que transita entre a comédia e o drama com notável maestria. Sean Baker, ciente do talento da atriz, constrói o filme em torno de sua personagem, permitindo que Madison brilhe em cada cena. Sua atuação é ao mesmo tempo visceral e sutil, transmitindo emoções complexas sem exageros. Embora os coadjuvantes tenham seus momentos de destaque, é Madison quem carrega o filme, oferecendo uma atuação multifacetada que exige tanto carisma quanto vulnerabilidade.nnOutro ponto alto de Anora é a habilidade de Baker em transformar temas potencialmente pesados em algo palatável, sem diluir sua importância. Questões como trabalho sexual, desigualdade social e a busca por validação permeiam o filme, mas são abordadas com delicadeza, permitindo que o público reflita sem se sentir sobrecarregado. Essa abordagem evita o didatismo e reforça a autenticidade da narrativa.nnEm resumo, Anora é um filme que cativa, diverte e provoca reflexões profundas. Sean Baker demonstra mais uma vez seu talento para capturar a essência da humanidade em seus aspectos mais contraditórios, entregando uma obra que é tão equilibrada quanto envolvente. Com uma direção segura, uma protagonista arrebatadora e uma narrativa que transita com fluidez entre leveza e impacto, Anora é um triunfo que reafirma Baker como um dos grandes nomes do cinema contemporâneo.",D,1/25/2025

rw10281627,tt32144488,Hacking Hate (2024),"Hacking Hate raises serious concerns regarding the ethics, bias, and misleading nature of its portrayal of individuals and groups. Labeling everyday people as extremists without clear evidence or justification is not only unethical but also dangerous. These mischaracterizations can have profound, far-reaching consequences, putting individuals who have done nothing wrong in harm's way.nnThe book appears to conflate regular citizens with radicals based on loose associations or shared values, rather than concrete evidence of illegal or hateful actions. This broad generalization creates a narrative that stigmatizes entire groups and fosters division. Many of the individuals targeted by such narratives have no record of hate speech or criminal behavior. They are ordinary people expressing concerns about cultural preservation, societal changes, or political issues-topics that should be open to discussion in a free society. By lumping these individuals into categories of extremism, the book fails to distinguish between genuine threats and legitimate concerns, which is a disservice to truth and justice.nnMischaracterization is not just a theoretical issue; it has real-world consequences. Those unfairly labeled as extremists can face serious repercussions, such as harassment, loss of employment, social ostracism, or even physical danger. In today's hyperconnected world, where information spreads rapidly, such labeling can result in lasting damage to personal and professional lives. Moreover, it fosters an atmosphere of fear and mistrust, making constructive dialogue nearly impossible.nnThe book's approach also raises ethical concerns about responsible journalism. Investigative reporting is powerful, but it comes with the responsibility to be thorough, fair, and accurate. Any failure to provide concrete evidence or distinguish between harmful ideologies and normal political discourse undermines journalistic integrity. By focusing on sensationalism rather than nuance, works like Hacking Hate risk becoming propaganda tools, deepening the very divides they claim to address.nnThe societal impact of this kind of narrative is equally troubling. When people feel unfairly vilified or excluded from mainstream discussions, it can lead to resentment and, ironically, further polarization. Demonizing individuals or groups without cause pushes them to the margins, where they are less likely to engage constructively. This cycle of alienation and misunderstanding exacerbates divisions and undermines the possibility of finding common ground.nnIn conclusion, Hacking Hate seems to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misrepresentations, endangering innocent individuals and undermining efforts to promote unity. By failing to base its claims on clear evidence and engaging in broad generalizations, it risks inflaming tensions rather than addressing the root causes of societal issues. Ethical journalism must prioritize truth and fairness, ensuring that the voices of ordinary people are not drowned out by sweeping and harmful narratives. Misrepresentation is not just unfair-it's dangerous, and the consequences of such actions cannot be ignored.",D,1/25/2025

A trama gira em torno de Wallace, o ótimo inventor, e seu leal cão Gromit, que se veem em apuros quando um gnomo robô, criado por Wallace para ajudar Gromit, começa a apresentar comportamentos inquietantes. Essa reviravolta na configuração traz à tona questões sobre a relação homem-máquina e as consequências inesperadas da tecnologia.nnA narrativa se desenvolve de forma coerente e divertida, com toques de humor característicos de Park. Os diálogos são inteligentes, e as expressões faciais dos personagens, criadas em stop-motion, transmitem emoções de maneira única. O cenário, recheado de detalhes minuciosos, cria um ambiente rico e envolvente.nnO ponto forte do filme é a exploração da dinâmica entre Wallace e Gromit, que reflete a amizade verdadeira e a lealdade. Gromit, como sempre, é o coração da história, mostrando que mesmo quando as coisas vão mal, a determinação e a inteligência podem prevalecer. O gnomo robô, ao se tornar uma ameaça, provoca reflexões sobre a dependência da tecnologia e a necessidade de cautela ao lidar com invenções.nnVisualmente, ""Avengança"" é um deleite, com a técnica de stop-motion proporcionando charme e autenticidade. Os personagens são expressivos, e cada cena é um testemunho do trabalho artesanal envolvido na produção.nnEntretanto, alguns podem achar que a transição de um filme leve e humorístico para uma narrativa mais sombria é abrupta. Essa mudança pode não agradar a todos, especialmente os fãs mais jovens. Contudo, essa profundidade emocional eleva o filme, proporcionando um diálogo sobre a responsabilidade humana em relação às suas invenções.nnNo geral, ""Wallace & Gromit: Avengança"" é um filme que combina humor, emoção e uma mensagem relevante. Mesmo com a mudança de tom, ele permanece fiel à essência da série, garantindo que tanto novos espectadores quanto os fãs de longa data encontrem algo especial nessa nova aventura. É uma jornada que equilibrar humor e reflexão, um verdadeiro deleite para todas as idades.",D,1/24/2025

Even if they wanted to pop Tony, they wouldn't have done it so close to establishing a truce, especially since Phil was out of the picture.nn3. How did the assassin figure out they were going to Holstens? Did Tony make a Facebook post ""Phil's dead! Time to hit Holstens with the family for a celebratory shake! :)) ""??? It was out of character for the family. They would have celebrated the end of the war with a steak; not shitty onion rings.nn4. The rumor going around that Patsi brokered the hit.

There is absolutely no way this hit would happen in this way if Patsi was involved.nn5. It would have been way too contrived of an ending. There is no rhyme or reason to the whole execution of the hit, ergo, it did not happen.nn6. When Tony looks up and the scene goes black, he is looking at Meadow coming in.

rw10255999,tt5875444,"""Slow Horses"" (2022)","Slow Horses is a sharp, stylish, and darkly comedic spy thriller that stands out in the crowded genre by focusing not on glamorous espionage action but on flawed, disillusioned intelligence agents operating at the margins of MI5. Based on Mick Herron's acclaimed novel of the same name, the series introduces viewers to a team of misfit spies who are relegated to a dilapidated office known as ""Slough House"" after botching their previous operations. The show's unique premise, complex characters, and clever writing make it one of the most compelling and refreshingly original spy thrillers in recent years.nnAt the heart of Slow Horses is Jackson Lamb, played with masterful irreverence by Gary Oldman. Lamb is the foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, and perpetually disgruntled leader of the ""slow horses,"" a group of disgraced MI5 agents who have been sidelined after failing in their careers. Oldman's portrayal of Lamb is both hilarious and haunting-he brings an edge to the character, making him a bit of an anti-hero, someone you can't help but root for despite his abrasive personality. Lamb's sardonic wit, sharp intelligence, and deeply cynical worldview are a perfect counterpoint to the often stifling and bureaucratic world of British intelligence. The character is a breath of fresh air in a genre often filled with morally upstanding and heroic agents.nnThe rest of the cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Kristin Scott Thomas as the icy and calculating head of MI5, and Jack Lowden, who plays River Cartwright, the ambitious but naïve young agent who has been sent to Slough House as a punishment. River's journey is particularly compelling, as he grapples with his desire for redemption while navigating the chaotic and often absurd world of Slough House. The ensemble cast does an excellent job of breathing life into the characters, making them feel real, flawed, and relatable.nnThe show's strength lies in its ability to balance dark humor with tense, high-stakes espionage drama. The script, adapted from Herron's novel, is full of biting dialogue and sharp wit, which elevates the series beyond your typical spy fare. The characters' interpersonal dynamics, particularly Lamb's gruff mentorship of River and the often-hilarious office politics within Slough House, provide a much-needed levity to the otherwise tense and suspenseful atmosphere. The humor feels natural and never undermines the high-stakes drama, which is a tricky balance to achieve.nnThe show's pacing is also notable. Slow Horses takes its time to develop the characters and build suspense, allowing viewers to become invested in their struggles and motivations. Unlike many fast-paced thrillers, the show doesn't rush through its plot. Instead, it slowly unfurls the mystery surrounding a dangerous terrorist plot that could jeopardize national security. This deliberate pace creates a sense of tension and anticipation, drawing the audience deeper into the world of espionage. As the characters uncover clues and navigate the political minefield within MI5, the story becomes more engaging, with each episode peeling back layers of the mystery.nnOne of the series' standout elements is its exploration of the consequences of failure within the intelligence community. The agents of Slough House are there because of their past mistakes, and the show dives deep into the psychological toll of being cast aside by the very institution they once served. River, in particular, is a character torn between the desire to prove himself and the resentment of being relegated to a backwater office. The show doesn't shy away from exploring the darker side of intelligence work-failure in the field has real-world consequences, and those who make mistakes are often punished with bureaucratic exile.nnVisually, Slow Horses has a sleek, moody atmosphere that mirrors the tone of the story. The production design reflects the drab, institutional environment of Slough House, creating a sense of decay and stagnation that perfectly complements the show's themes. The cinematography is restrained but striking, with moody lighting and muted color palettes that emphasize the gritty, sometimes oppressive nature of the characters' world. The visual style adds to the feeling that Slough House is a place where careers go to die, a fitting metaphor for the characters' struggles.nnThe show also doesn't shy away from the contemporary political landscape, weaving in relevant issues such as surveillance, privacy, and the ethics of espionage. It's a commentary on how intelligence work has evolved in the modern age-how the lines between right and wrong blur, and how those in positions of power are often more concerned with self-preservation than the greater good. These themes give Slow Horses a sense of relevance and depth, making it more than just a typical spy show.nnWhat truly makes Slow Horses stand out, however, is its embrace of complexity. The characters are flawed and multidimensional, and the story doesn't offer easy answers. Each character is dealing with their own demons and ambitions, which makes the series feel more human and relatable than many other thrillers in the genre. Lamb, for example, may be a brash and seemingly indifferent leader, but as the series progresses, we begin to see glimpses of a man who is more than just his gruff exterior. River's arc, too, is one of self-discovery, as he learns that being a good spy requires more than just following orders-it's about navigating moral gray areas, balancing duty with personal integrity, and sometimes even embracing failure.nnThe show's combination of intricate plotting, character development, and dark humor ensures that Slow Horses remains consistently engaging. The slow build of suspense, paired with its sharp wit and emotional depth, makes it a standout in the crowded spy genre. It doesn't rely on explosive action sequences or over-the-top set pieces; instead, it focuses on the human element of espionage-on the people behind the intelligence reports, the failures, and the compromises.nnIn conclusion, Slow Horses is an exceptionally well-crafted and refreshingly unique spy thriller. With its smart writing, stellar performances, and complex characters, it offers a deeper, more introspective take on the espionage genre. Gary Oldman's masterful portrayal of Jackson Lamb is a highlight, and the ensemble cast adds further depth to a story that is as much about personal redemption and the consequences of failure as it is about national security. If you're looking for a spy series that blends sharp wit with suspense and emotional resonance, Slow Horses is a must-watch.

rw10255983,tt4281724,Terrifier (2016),"From the preview, you want to like it. Once the wheels start spinning though, it just starts losing traction. The makeup of Art the Clown looks creepy and nightmarish when you first see him. Once he's knocked around a bit, the mask just looks like a sick psychotic person wearing a poorly fitting mask. He isn't scary. He just looks like a pervert who likes to mutilate people, not someone or something like Chucky, Jason, Mike or Freddy, who really makes you jump out of your seat. There's a lack of surprises, no suspenseful buildup. You even know what order the silly characters are going to be killed in. If serial murders and mutilations were categorized, this one would equate to standing in line at the post office or DMV wishing the experience would be less boring and get over with quickly, and that's with it only being an hour and 25 minutes long. You could have seen Goosebumps 10 times, and it would still be scarier than this. It was rated R due to nudity of two of the female victims, some foul language, and maybe the unscary profuse gore. Even the sci-fi reanimation of Art was subpar. My 14 year old daughter wanted to stay up with my wife and I to watch a horror movie. She wanted something to give her a nightmare.

rw10255976,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"Emilia Pérez, a 2024 French-Mexican musical crime comedy, was one of the biggest surprises of the year for me. The film doesn't simply rely on genre tropes; instead, it cleverly intertwines a lawyer's financial struggles, a transgender person's psychological journey, and societal crime issues into a captivating narrative. It's not just entertainment; it's an artistic exploration of social themes.nnThe economic pressures faced by lawyer Rita Moro Castro (Zoe Saldana) are crucial to the plot's progression. Her need to survive forces her to make morally questionable choices, prompting viewers to reflect on the boundaries between law and ethics. The transgender experience of drug lord Juan ""Manitas"" Del Monte (Karla Sofía Gascón) delves deeper into the complex issues of gender identity and societal prejudice. Karla Sofía Gascón's portrayal of Emilia is stunning; her exceptional acting perfectly captures the character's internal struggles and transformation. I won't spoil it, but her performance is a major highlight of the film.nnBeyond the compelling plot, Emilia Pérez is also an excellent musical. The musical numbers aren't just for entertainment; they advance the plot, express character emotions, and enhance the film's artistic merit. Overall, the actors deliver outstanding performances. The two lead actresses, Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofía Gascón, are particularly noteworthy, their nuanced portrayals showcasing the characters' complexity and multifaceted nature. The dedication and high standards of the entire behind-the-scenes team are evident.nnIn conclusion, Emilia Pérez is a highly recommended film. It boasts a captivating plot, superb acting, and beautiful musical numbers, but more importantly, it touches upon significant social issues that leave a lasting impression and encourage reflection.",A,12/01/2025

Thoroughly traumatized, she discovers that she's able to take refuge from the horror by entering a Hallmark-style small town Christmas movie... for a while, anyways.

rw10255750,tt7335184,"""You"" (2018)","This series essentially repeats Dexter: a psychopath who is like this becuase of some trauma in his childhood, and now he keeps getting away with murders. Except that here it's all done for love and women. The attempt to make this show likable by female audience forces it to follow the conventions of the entertainment material targeted at women. What's those?nnFirst, the character is your typcial ""dangerous man who got tamed by the heorine"", exactly what women find sexy (at least according to Jordan Peterson, if you care for he says anyway). To a male viewer, the core idea in the plot that some guy would do serial killings just to be liked by some girl is ridiculous. If a guy would go to such lengths, it would likely be for some more man-like reason. E.g. Raping those victims. Or, like Dexter, restoring ""social justice"". Or something else like money, power, fame, maybe religion or some crazy global conspiracy theories. Taking huge risks just as part of the courtship ritual is absurdly unrealistic, yet obviously plays to the fantasy of female viewers. Cuz see how much the girl valued here! Serial murders are committed in her name, wow! And that's boring/meh to male viewers. Men like porn, not romantic novels about Spanish princes courting your random average Cinderella.nnSecond, the focus of this show is always on the female characters! The male ""protagonist"" here is 2D and never really explored. We don't even learn about him much untill later, even until the closing episodes of season 2! Like in most women-targeted content, the man is never an actor of his own. Instead, he is just an attribute, an accessory to women. Like, in a dress-up game for 4 year old girls on an iPad, you'd first dress up the girl into a luxurious bridal dress, and then, as an afterthought, put a groom nearby as a single item. Similarly to how you'd put a pet puppy, a cage with a parrot or a pony ride. The girls are the real actors here. Also, we always see the relatives and the friend circle of the girls. Because that's what makes life of a female viewer. And the protagonist (the serial killer) has no one. He just appeared from thin air, like a hologram or a 2D cardboard. ""Hi! Here I am. I'm a dangerous guy but I love you, so I'll serve you like a tiger pet in World of Warcraft. Just give me some meat occasionally and I'll tank the mobs for you"".nnThird, the female characters have interesting lives here while the guys are either losers or nobodies. In the first season, the girl is an aspiring writer. She has a goal in life, a career ahead of her. What does the guy do? Nothing! He just ""owns a bookstore"". 1 ""hobby"", reading. That's it. Aside from reading books, this guy does nothing. Well, he kills people to get liked by the heroine. But other than that, nothing. No gaming or sports or other typical guy's interests. No desire to go to college, or get rich, or create/invent/discore something. Why? Because it's a movie for women. If this guy would have any manly interests, it would move him away from the female viewer. Instead, he needs to like things that women like. Reading is gender-neutral, even a bit womanly. So, that's fine. Everything else? Hm... I guess it would work if he'd like travelling and dining in restaurants. But that would contradict the ""dangerous"" attribute. Reading physcial paper books looks weird/retro enough to your average female viewer, so that works fine for a ""serial killer"".nnForth, notice how murders aren't really shown. We rarely actually see this guy murder anyone, especially the girls. E.g. Season 1 ends with the guy merely grabbing the girl. Just imagine how gruesome the actual murder scene would look! But no, the show writers can't do that because this would make the character unlikeable by women. He has to stay likable. For that, he must be just ""dangerous"" but not the actual unhinged meat-grinding machine that he pretends to be here. See, it was a difficult task for the show writers to present a serial killer in a way that he wold fit the female-likeable archetype! I guess I have to applaud them for completing their mission. Yet, since their target audience wasn't even men (and I'm a man), it's kinda irrelevant to me.nnOverall, the show is still somewhat fun to watch simply due to frequent plot turns and the tension it manages to keep up. As long as you don't try to bother with the psychology and the motivations of the characters. And are okay listinening to boring conversations between mediocre female friends here and there. There is no uniqueness or ""spark"" here though. It's nowhere near Dexter or great shows like Breaking Bad, for example. It's a passable and forgettable show that you probably will get completely bored of by the end of season 2.",A,12/01/2025
rw10255720,tt9218128,Gladiator II (2024),"Not impressed with any of the actors performances or the story line. Pretty vague, no depth and without seeing the original it might not even had made much sense. Perhaps the actors themselves weren't passionate about the film either, considering the seasoned cast. When characters died, there was no reaction from Lucius. Just a weird smile thing that he kept doing followed by cheesy cinematography and dramatic music. There was no attachment with the audience, either. When it ended, on another weird cheesy scene, I was glad to just be done watching it.nnAt the end of the day, this was just a mediocre at best film. If you're a fan of the original, you'll most likely be disappointed if you watch it. I was. Some movies don't need a remake.",A,12/01/2025

I feel like it is a modern copy of the Portrait of Dorian Gray, The Wild Ass's Skin or The Devil in the Bottle, but extremely poorly done, a fraud. Nothing new, where the subject is addressed in an extremely predictable way and also contains a lot of filler, especially at the end where it is exaggeratedly prolonged, repeating the subject that has been made clear in the first 30 minutes.

It draws on true situations of emotions from different spaces of humanity. The acting brings two extreme versions of our own selves with its subconscious or next of close relationship person (the voice always in our head) and shows how gravity forces pull but maintain love.

rw10255656,tt1354003,La fonte des neiges (2009),"""La fonte des neiges"" is a happy, sincere affirmation about the positive value of poise and self-confidence in one's own, completely nude body.nnThe film is set entirely within a European nudist resort, occupied by entire families of self-confident and self-accepting nudists: grandparents, parents, teenage children, younger children, and babies.nnThe main character is Leo, and he appears to be about 13 years old. By natural inclination, Leo is a little stand-offish & reserved; his first gut-reaction upon entering the nudist resort is to bundle up, even though the rest of his family fully disrobes without a second thought, Leo dons a winter coat and puts on a mask over his eyes in reaction to witnessing all the self-possessed, confident nudity in the nude camp.nnWhen Leo meets & befriends a pretty, self-confident, nude teenage girl, he begins to internally reassess his chilly attitude toward his own body.nnThe English title for this movie is ""Thawing Out,"" and this section of the movie is indeed about young Leo ""warming up"" to the progressive realization that his own body is a sunny manifestation of Life's realities. With the companionship of the older teenage girl as moral support, Leo soon sheds all his clothing & is poised & relaxed while moving around the nudist camp with his companion in close proximity.nnThe boy Leo is not stunningly beautiful, like a 13-year-old sculptor's, painter's, or Fine-Art photographer's model might be; rather Leo is appealingly cute & sturdily put together for a youth of his age.nnAll the plentiful nudity in this fine film is solidly family-centered and life-affirming. Nothing whatsoever sexually explicit occurs in ""La fonte des neiges,"" so if you're seeking out a ""sexy"" film, keep looking elsewhere, because you will find nothing sexually explicit in this movie!nnAt one point, at the teenage girl's invitation, Leo briefly touches one of her breasts; yet even this is not sexual in nature, but rather, the sincere expression of innocent curiosity (he's never touched a breast before - what could that possibly feel like?). Leo is simply seeking out tactile sensations. And so, this short film moves onward in the spirit of positive self-assertion & pleasant discovery.nnAt least initially, there is likely to be a prominent, perceptual difference in how this movie is received by American viewers versus European viewers. And that difference is caused in the following ways:nIn the United States of America, young children are often taught - either explicitly or implicitly - that the completely nude human body is somehow ""shameful"" or ""unpresentable."" The American child intuits ""the body"" to mean ""my own body;"" and so the American child internalizes the message ""my own body is shameful & unpresentable"" at a young age. The nude human body is regarded as something akin to a closely guarded, State Military Secret, and the acceptable occurrences of complete nudity are severely limited to showering & bathing, marital intimacy, and visits to one's medical doctor.nnAt issue also is the status of the Fine Arts in the U. S. A. The American nude sculptor; the American nude painter; and the American Nude Fine-Art Photographer are largely ignored by the American citizenry, and they don't garner anywhere near the respect and renown that their counterparts in Europe enjoy.nnFinally, the repositories of the ""proof positive"" regarding the Beauty & luminosity of the nude, American body - that is to say, the art galleries & art museums - are sparsely attended; and the instances of art exhibits promoting ""The Nude"" are kept artificially low in the U. S. A.!nnIn Europe, however, you have an entirely different attitude & an entirely different set of values regarding the completely nude human body. In Europe, the human body is regarded as a substantial, naturally occurring, happy manifestation of earthly Life, especially during one's prime of life (16- to 25-years-old?). Even European Religious Conservatives are fond of recounting the Biblical passage where humankind is described as being ""Made in the image of God,"" strongly implying that the nude human body is a pleasing articulation of God's Creative Powers - now that's a strong affirmation for the children of European religious Conservatives to internalize & believe in!nnEuropean children are taught to keep their bodies clean & healthy, so they can exhibit self-confidence & calm poise when they are nude; it is the parents' responsibility to instill these positive values into their children's value system & mindset. And, in many European countries, the positive, aesthetically pleasing value placed upon nudity is plainly evident:nn1) France & Spain; these two countries have the finest nude beaches and the finest nudist resorts & nudist camps in the world! Every summer, thousands upon thousands of citizens visit these establishments, and many bring their entire families along with them. Grandparents, parents, teenage children, younger children, and babies all enjoy these nudist establishments together (with the babies necessarily wearing diapers).nnThe finest stretches of beachfront are usually set aside for nude use; and the resorts & camps are clean, well-maintained, financially robust, and accommodate heavy, regular traffic.nn2) Germany; Has established, legally designated ""Nude Zones"" in its public parks; within these nude zones, visitors can walk or jog, sleep, lounge, sunbathe or simply congregate and talk with other visitors. This practice, referred to as ""Free Body Culture,"" emphasizes body positivity & a connection with Nature!nn3) The Netherlands; Has established, officially designated nude beaches. Nudity is recognized as lawful in areas where nude usage has been traditionally established for years, and in any areas where it is not specifically prohibited.nn4) Finland, Sweden, and Norway; After long, very cold winters, citizens take advantage of the short, warm summers by sunbathing & swimming nude. Also, complete nudity is assumed & expected while enjoying saunas; the entire family is expected to participate, including teenagers & children. Complete nudity is encouraged as part of the authentic, traditional sauna experience. The wearing of swimsuits & undergarments are prohibited as they are considered unhygienic. Small-sized towels to sit down upon are permitted, but larger towels designed to wrap around your waist are prohibited.nn5) Iceland; Complete nudity is encouraged during the enjoyment of natural hot springs, pools, and spas.nnIt is important to note that all of the cast of ""La fonte des neiges"" - even the older folks - evince a calm dignity about their physical selves, and young Leo finds peacefulness & self-assurance in calmly presenting his sturdy, nude, 13-year-old body.nnFor American viewers wishing to appreciate ""La fonte des neiges,"" I give this advice: 1) First of all, RELAX before watching the film - there is nothing whatsoever confrontational or sexually explicit in this 28-minute-long movie!; 2) If you have deeply ingrained, negative attitudes regarding the nude human body (including your own body), try to set these negative attitudes aside temporarily, and simply let the quiet magic of ""La fonte des neiges"" wash over you!; 3) Try to appreciate the nude bodies in the same way you might appreciate a sunrise or the roll of incoming waves crashing upon a pristine beach! Both the beautiful, feminine companion of Leo & the cute, youthful sturdiness of Leo himself have their luminous appeal, but that appeal is not sexual in nature, rather their appeal is organically self-evident, and grounded in peacefulness & calm.nnIf after you watch ""La fonte des neiges,"" you want to readopt your deeply ingrained, negative attitudes about nudity, by all means, do so, if that somehow makes you feel more comfortable. Just please don't let your negative attitudes poison your full appreciation of this excellent short film! As I urged before, set your negative attitudes aside for the full duration of the movie; it's only 28 minutes long, and that's not an arduous task!nnIf you're a European viewer, you need no advice; you already have the positive mindset and appreciative value system required! So sit back & enjoy!",A,12/01/2025

He's definitely not the future of pretty boy actors - in my opinion. If this movie becomes wide spread, it might destroy his career. The story was all over the place. I looked at my watch a lot and was really glad when it was over. Retta was wonderful and I just wanted to yell, ""Treat Yourself!"" every time she was on screen because seeing her was a treat to me.

It's just amazing how it has come out and become more of a theme. It is interesting that this is about a classical music artist as supposed to now pop artists that are more prevalent nowadays.

rw10255564,tt30444418,Santosh (2024),"Santosh - a movie where BBC was involved. As soon as I saw that, I knew this will be nothing more than a propaganda stunt.

Its like a typical Crime P@trol show episode, just longer.nnI could not make sense of most of the things in the movie because most of it was intended and not clearly established. The director tried to experiment but could not establish if the lead was a lesbian or no OR if the police officer who investigated the case, was that or no. There were signs. The only lead investigated was a phone of the victim and nothing else. While the victim was found in the water well, her phone was at home? I failed to see why the movie got so many accolades.

It's just like most of the CBS Paramount line up... Tailored for boomers and middle America. Is the storyline compelling? Sure. But the tropes. My god, the tropes.

rw10255532,tt0033902,Men of Boys Town (1941),"... MEN OF BOYS TOWN still managed to fall into every pothole the earlier film avoided.nnFather Flannigan (Spencer Tracy) has expanded Boy's Town without the money to finish the new additions. So he's on the hook for 200K that he doesn't have for wings that are not finished. Just like in the first film, he follows his heart and not a balance sheet. He taps philanthropist Dave Morris (Lee J. Cobb) to help him with the predicament. But Morris is more of a money spelunker than a money man himself, so while the rest of the plot progresses, he looks for truly wealthy people who can help him.nnSince Whitey was reformed in the original film, he can no longer take on the role of deliberate mischief maker. So I guess it's a tribute to Mickey Rooney's acting talents that it takes two child actors to replace his part in the original as the tough kid who won't be taken in or softened up by ""the hooey"" Boy's Town is serving up. One kid was found guilty of manslaughter and has been ""paroled"" to Boy's Town. The catch being that he has a broken back and is thus paralyzed from the waist down. The other tough kid is ""Flip"" who escapes in Whitey's (Rooney's) car -without Whitey's knowledge - when Whitey goes to visit a boy who is in a reformatory.nnThe film takes a dark turn for a while towards the end when it shows the brutality dished out to the children being held in that reformatory. Arthur Hoyl is great as a brutal and sadistic reformatory guard. Of course, part of what makes these 30s and 40s films great are the supporting actors who always played certain types of roles. Hohl was almost always the slippery villain, so the film does not need to take up time and space telling you what kind of person his character is. When you first see him, you just know he's trouble.nnIf you liked the first film you'll like this one. Of course it's somewhat derivative, but that's probably what audiences wanted when they bought a movie ticket to a Boy's Town film in the first place.",A,12/01/2025

The fleeting love, the superstitions of those caught in power struggles they can't control.nnWhat's even more outstanding than the depth of the topics and their marvellous satirical joyful tone is the atmosphere. So charming and alert. Full of a full spectrum of emotions, from picaresque to delicate erotic power struggles like the scene when the beautiful Countess both seduces and overpowers the genius creator (Rossini) who's in the nonchalant position of selling out for the privilege of making art, both astutely aware of it and slightly ashamed AND grateful for the joyride through life his talents allow through his masters. But when the Countess stands in the inn room and dominates him mentally like the superior moral conscience she is, she's also reaching down to him and offering understanding, redemption. And at the same time, testing him. An exceptional female character of strength and elegance of spirit and intellect such as we can only find in period cinema nowadays... As the trend for ""strong female characters"" in contemporary stories is for no moral conscience, no elegance, and no feminine grace. The scene between the two is beyond romantic, it takes its intense charge from the realities it represents: the artist and his conscience; the Faustian pact he signs in order to be allowed the toys of his creation, the freedom of exerting his talent. The two actors are splendid in these roles, which can't be easy to perform when there is much meaning beyond the surface seduction level visible to the eye and the jealous innkeeper's daughter. The latter representing the almost atavistic forces of society, the raw emotions but also medieval superstitions of the poorer classes, caught up as disposable plaything in the games of the rich that stop at the inn, by accident.nnTomes could be written about this movie, in which everything has oodles of meaning. I'm sure the merit is to a very large degree that of the director, Nae Caranfil, but also the story itself. Although one cannot help but wonder how much of that spirited, satirical but ultimately benevolent wry smile of the creator is Caranfil, and how much comes from the book. It's a tone and an attitude the director brings to each movie, and which transfers very well from Romanian cinema to this international story, of a different era. Because great universal human truths are pretty transferable in place and time. The narcissistic, insecure, delusional character of poor Beyle could easily be one of those mumbling navel-gazing hipsters in today's cinema, yoyo-ing between over-stating his appeal and devastating insecurity before the fairer, and in this film, it seems, the smarter, braver sex.nnSuch characters read very current. Human folly is a constant regardless of time and place. Finely observed by Nae with equal parts condemnation and realistic ridicule, and forgiveness, for in his universe, all the characters suffer with some form of folly. A closest approximation to life one can find in cinema. Where ridicule, chance, irony and low rank passions frequently lead heroes to denouements their ambitions, aspirations and notion of self never would, if unhampered. The gap between ego-bubble-driven expectation and reality. But as it is, our folly, our ideal selves, our aspirations (Beyle's pseudo romantic projects, Rossini's constant pursuit of creation on a production line, the freedom and independence pursued by the partisans ending up in failure due to, not lack of military tactics, honor or courage but... Superstition).. these idealised self perceptions of people always crash and burn in Nae's movies because of ironic sabotage of great projects by petty passions, like pebbles that bring down empires, as it were. It's an almost Shakespearean view, an all seeing, all understanding eye of the creator. A creator that truly understands the entirety of the Human tragi-comedy and despite experiencing the full spectrum of human experience (love, warfare, friendship, betrayal), isn't ever silly enough to over-indulge any of them, as he's all too wise and knows nothing lasts the test of time; nothing, not even the most delicate of loves and honourable of freedom-fighting, is spared of ridicule and farce on the long term. This alone, which spans all of his movies, is alone an attitude that makes him as an Artist suitable for the pantheon of Great art and cinema, with perennial quality; I place him in the same family as the Coen Brothers. But the same quality makes him perhaps not so popular today, an age I call the Age of Mediocretes; where art, cinema and stories in general (""girl fiction"", hello!) are expected to offer a Disney-fied, sugared, cheesy, naive view of the world.nnWhere people are expected to be simplistic caricatures of human motivations, with no self awareness, idealised selves and little humor.nnI can only speculate that an audience, here or in Romania, raised on the milquetoast art of the last two decades, will write negative, assinine reviews like the gentleman before.nnBut what I'd like to know is why this film doesn't have wider circulation, seeing as it's perfectly timeless, and completely international.nnI thought I should expect a Romanian slant or flavour considering who the movie maker is. But no. Perhaps an Italian or French viewer could comment better, but to me it seems like the film nails the idiosyncrasies of those glorious two nations in their specific historic moment really smoothly, with grace.nnI won't comment on a favourite part of the movie which is the freedom fighters. Because of the current political landscape, which is perhaps a comment in itself-the best one, really.nnI did feel a sense of unsatisfaction athe end: I wanted more. More of each subplot. More of each character. I would like a whole series with Rossini, the pathetic but ultimately loveable Beyle, the beautiful Countess and the lucky Nencini .. all featuring their own intricate plotlines.

I tried to like the character but the fact that she thinks it's ok to be with married men made it pretty hard. When she starts giving sex advice to her married friend it got too weird.

I liked her in Big Little Lies, but in Babygirl, I found it repetitive. I didn't see much difference between her two characters. The orgasm scenes are well done; they feel real and are far from the stereotype of pornography. There were several elements of the story that added nothing to the development: the fact that she was raised in a cult or the presence of her daughters. One can have sexual desires regardless of being raised in a cult, and a psychologist could confirm my view. The daughters were there to show her as a top mother, but that aspect is never fully developed, and she doesn't come across as a super dedicated mother or a highly driven businesswoman. Her character isn't fully fleshed out. The young man has only one expression throughout the film, which gets a bit boring.

rw10255252,tt32411153,Pian pian xi huan ni (2024),"One thing which draws me to contemporary PRC cinema is that on average, their films (at least the ones good enough to get overseas screenings) tend to be more grounded, more cynical and more interested in the workings of a society than the comparable Western film of a corresponding genre.nnHere, this comparison is not so clear-cut - because the premise strongly (if unintentionally - the movies were released within 3 months of each other) echoes Josh Margolin's Thelma, which was also both a comedy about a scam and a film with a lot of amusing yet meaningful comments on its society. Relative to Thelma, it is actually Honey Money Phony which is more beholden to classic crime comedy tropes over social realism.nnQuite often, it takes shortcuts in an attempt to score easy laugh lines - i.e. The classic metaphor of scammers as wolves and their prey as the sheep is reinforced with the SFX of howling and bleating played whenever the predator and the ""unwitting"" mark try their best. The humour in a scene with a gap-toothed character who sprays so much saliva a small dog in the room ends up drenched by the time he is done talking is rather beneath what I have come to expect from a PRC film.nnAt the same time, this is STILL a modern PRC film, so the social realist DNA is not absent, and the story can still be quite acidic when it counts. For instance, Lin has a properly realized backstory explaining how she had come to be in such a situation - including an ignored report of sexual harassment causing her to move to ""Koo Aang"" (renamed Macao) in the first place. The male scammer's backstory is surprisingly downbeat for the genre - not ""dark"" in the edgy sense, but simply a disappointingly plausible tale of parental neglect.nnThe film can also be vaguely compared to Now You See Me, in the sense that both involve scamming a single unsympathetic guy out of a lot of money, albeit by very different methods. The parallel becomes intentional when it also involves a scene with love locks on a bridge - but while the idea was played completely straight in Now You See Me, here Lin and her friend ask the male lead Ooyang and his uncle for help in lockpicking AWAY the love locks they left during the past relationships turned sour. It comes across as a very intentional counterpoint - and the cynicism is highlighted further when a photo vendor snaps the two leads and offers a locket with their photo. In response to their denials, he simply assumes they are adulterous and proposes a shielded locket with the photo hidden beneath a sliding cover.nnI haven't spoken much about the core of the story, which is a classic crime comedy, but it's basically fine. Certainly more than a little predictable and overlong at times, but it still got more than enough laughs out of me. It helps that it invests attention to detail like the actual workings of bank transactions which lesser works often miss. The characters are all fun enough to follow and the epilogue thankfully does not forget about any one of them.nnAll in all, looking at it rationally this is probably the weakest and least substantial year 2024 PRC film I saw - but it still made me laugh a lot, and remains one of the better films I saw from that year.",A,11/01/2025

But the story turns absurd when she's kidnapped again and Sa-Eon abandons his wealth for unclear reasons. Unanswered questions, such as the kidnapper's survival, detract from the narrative.

So wouldn't be all too surprising if 100-bucks-for-a-used-panty fans would go and ""rectify"" the movie's message.nnThe movie portrays Emma and Eddie, two porn creators with care, an outside-in perspective, and without an in-your-face judgement, not unlike Scorsese's approach in the Wolf of Wall Street.

If I'm being honest with myself then this isn't new or original but it was disgusting and spooky and gloomy and especially Lily Rose Depp was amazing in her performance. I loved the use of makeup and old school gore in this, Eggers was able to capture the eerie atmosphere of the 1922 Nosferatu and bring it to life with modern equipment. Probably my favourite part is Nosferatu himself, the care that went into the costume design and SFX Makeup is incredible. Everything about the costuming of this movie is absolutely delightful, the fit and silhouette of the dresses and suits shows how much thought was put into the setting. Even if the storyline lacks some depth and isn't very original in the genre of vampire horror, Eggers Nosferatu is still a must see for me, because it is just so beautiful to look at.nnPerfect movie for vampire enthusiasts who are fed up with sexy and beautiful creatures of the night and need a dose of living corpse for a change. Also perfect for fellow (period) costume design connoisseurs that still can't get over the catastrophe that was Little Women. Is it the feminist masterpiece many of us hoped for?

The Rookie is just one example of this, but there are many Wolf spinoffs that do it way, way better. The opening sequence was tired and very predictable- nothing was made of the people watching rather than helping, and the set-up of antagonistic energy between the main character and the sergeant was extremely uninteresting. OK I might be biased towards Eriq Lasalle, whomI think is a douche, but my point stands.nnThe acting is alright, but also nothing special.

There is no spoken dialogue, just music and noises which adds to the creepiness. The film just hits you with a barrage of unseemingly images that eventually all come together. It also does not follow a typical narrative structure. You get little bits of information to figure out what is going on.nnThe film is open to interpretation as well. It does touch on things like abuse, murder, assault, and traumatic loss.nnLike I said in my YouTube review - think Skinamarink meets Flowers but closer to Flowers.

rw10254687,tt14351082,Cabrini (2024),"Cabrini is a sobering representation of how wretched the times some may now call ""great"" were for a great swathe of people - including the immediate ancestors of those now settled comfortably. We get to be deeply immersed in those times through the eyes of the titular character, doing unglamorous yet all-too-necessary work, at a time and place many would now rather sweep under the rug.nnIn particular, a scene where the titular Italian nun, living on borrowed time due to lung disease from childhood, is able to secure aid from the wealthy Polish and Jewish elites of New York over their shared experience of racism might be blunt, but it works - and all the more so considering Alejandro Monteverde must have known how alienating it was going to be for the implicit core audience of an American Christian-themed film nowadays.nnAfter all, the only reason Monteverde was able to operate with a $50M budget for such a film was due to the runaway success of Sound of Freedom amongst that kind of audience. You can see where that money went, as the film employs A LOT of people for the very frequent crowd scenes - be they in Vatican, at the New York docks, throngs of children in the slums or at her care home, at the park fundraiser or during hospital construction. The investment into the film was far in excess of what it earned at the B. O., likely making it one of the greatest bombs of the year percentage-wise - but I would be hard-pressed to say it was ""wasted"".nnAltogether, this is the story where just the facts of her life - and of the context which surrounded her - are very strong. Thus, it is disappointing that the script also chooses to resort to a range of fabrications which generally weaken the overall narrative thrust. In particular, the political arc with the fictional mayor may be ""metaphorically true"", but its resolution is surprisingly timid, and arguably even unintentionally undermines one of the core principles of democracy while seemingly trying to do the opposite. The scene where she rallies support in front of the Italian Parliament also rings a little hollow when seemingly nobody asks a cynical yet entirely plausible question as to why those who chose to leave the country deserve its support more than those already in it.nnPerhaps the film would have been able to explore these facets better if it omitted something like the subplot with the local lady of the night. That aspect of the story appears to be completely fictional and while it's decently filmed, it does not add a whole lot besides giving Cabrini an opportunity to recount her past in front of the viewers to someone who doesn't already know it.nnIn all, I wish the story was better able to stick to the facts and explore their nuances, like several other biopics of 2024, but altogether, it is still a work worth seeing, and a definite recommendation of mine.",A,11/01/2025
rw10254664,tt13321244,Origin (2023),"Making a standout film about the process of writing a book is definitely a challenge - and Ava DuVernay is already one of the few to have ever taken it up, even if I cannot say she had fully succeeded at it.nnIf you are watching something like this in the first place, you would undoubtedly make allowances for pacing - yet even so, the first half is particularly glacial. After the opening which effectively recreates a notorious page in recent American history, the events just kinda happen, and it's not very clear what they are leading up to.nnYou can make the case that this is exactly how the process of writer's block should be portrayed, but it still doesn't make for captivating viewing. Even the death of Isabel's husband is just kinda....there. He is found dead on the floor, presumably from heart attack, but we just get so little context about it. I.e. There's nothing about how (un)likely it was statistically and if it could have been averted, which is one of the first questions those grieving tend to ask.nnOn the other hand, once the film starts to cohere in the second half, it does so very rapidly. Subplots that threatened to go nowhere at first get a satisfying resolution and the dive into history of the three countries offers some of the year's more interesting scenes. Thus, it is a film still worth seeing, even if I suspect it could have been better than it was.",A,11/01/2025

For this reason I will never watch the remake again, it purely felt like a pay day for the actors.nnI was a bit sceptical with Mufasa judging by some of the rubbish Disney have produced lately with odd exceptions of course. I read some of the reviews and wasn't expecting much but I must say if anything could replicate the feeling I had after first seeing the Lion King (1994) then this film is it. Yes I am older and see films from different aspects now but it felt more like the original and I think Aaron Pierre was brilliant as Mufasa. Tough shoes to fill from James Earl Jones but I did feel the remake lacked the same desire in his voice so fresh blood was needed and Aaron Pierre was exceptional. Tiffany Boone as Sarabi was great and Mads Mikkelsen is always excellent. Jeremy Irons will always be Scar for me though with his voice along with Rowen Atkinson as Zazu, I can't see their performances being surpassed.nnI saw an improvement in Pumba and Timon this time. I enjoyed how Rafiki had a strong role and brought humour but also strong messages across.nnSoundtrack wise, not all the songs are great but the ones that are I am still listening to now. Again, the standard of the original is so high it's hard to compete but some of the music from Mufasa is beautiful. Great performances is all I can say.nnMufasa is such a great inspiring character and I love how this film portrayed him. If the film did not do the character justice I would not be reviewing this film but I felt it was such a good movie and the comparisons to the likes of Sonic 3 are unfair in my opinion. They are different films with different messages.nnAll I can say is this film is the closest to the original Lion King and it has certainly had a lasting effect on me and I can't wait to watch it again. I certainly did not get the usual Disney woke experience on this film which was a welcome refreshing change.nnHope you enjoy it as much as I did.",A,11/01/2025

If you look at the reviews where people actually took the time to write comments vs just clicking a star, you'll see the positive reviews far out weigh the negative.nnThis was my first romantic Kdrama (I consider it my first Kdrama but since I did watch Squid Games first, I guess it actually holds that spot even though I didn't know what a Kdrama was when I watched it). But this series got me hooked on Kdrama's. I do not feel like there is anything being created in the US that compares. I love the slow paced romance based on small gestures of kindness vs just sex as is so common with US dramas. And I really like how they do not drag out the relationship setback misunderstandings...those usually get resolved within the beginning of the next episode if not the same episode.nnBut within King The Land, I really liked the strength in Sa-rang's character. How she quickly dealt with adversity herself rather than waiting for Gu Won or someone else to save her. I thought Im Yoon-ah did a great job with the character as did the other actors in the core group. I also liked the balance given between the main romantic thread between Sa-rang and Gu Won and that of the secondary romantic threads for Sa-rang's friends, Oh Pyeong-hwa and Kang Da-eul. I thought they gave enough time to the secondary threads to properly evolve them without taking away from the primary story.nnWhile this was my 'first', it will be far from my last Kdrama.

rw10254573,tt0346491,Alexander (2004),"It's said the attention span of modern generations is less than a goldfish. Heaven forbid a movie be just under 4 hours. A 21st century, 1st world luxury that would not have been imagined in the time of Alexander no doubt. Centuries from now this film will almost certainly be rated at a 9/10 or 10/10. A masterpiece for anyone with an attention span greater than a goldfish, and who can view great historical figures as actual humans (which they were) and not mythical fiction.nnFor those who have a giant ego due to their ancestry or whom write their own history based upon whatever contemporary mythical notions of historical figures entertain their psyche; no doubt this movie, nor any movie for that matter, will fail to live up to their illusions. Yet I say that says more about such people and their honestly delusional and narcissistic nature than it does about homo sapiens, humans, and the great history surrounding us.nnAll in all, this movie is a masterpiece should you give it the attention and honesty it deserves, in the context that we are humans, not some mythical beings descendant of Prometheus, angels, or whatnot. Alexander as a human, not Hercules born of a god. The fact this movie is rated 5 stars on imdb makes me lose faith in humanity. There are true narcissists out there in an unsettling number that conflate humanity with godhood. Alexander was indeed great, of that there is no question, yet he was human.

rw10254571,tt5516154,"""Godless"" (2017)","Correctly made, but characterless and full of colonial stereotypesnnGodless (2017) is a Western series that, at first glance, seems to offer an intriguing twist on classic genre tropes: a town run by women after a mining disaster wipes out the men, and an antagonist in the form of an unrelenting bandit challenging the ""civilized"" order of the West. However, upon closer examination, the series reveals deep problematic undertones that, from an anti-colonial perspective, make it deeply racist.nnAt its core, Godless presents a narrative about the ""Wild West"" in which white settlers are portrayed as the ""civilized"" ones, fighting against the forces of nature and the ""wild"" people. While the series claims to address female empowerment and the dismantling of patriarchal structures, it falls back into the racist clichés of the genre. The broader colonial context-the violence against indigenous peoples, forced relocations, and the systematic erasure of cultures-is almost entirely ignored.nnUltimately, Godless reveals itself as a series that uncritically perpetuates racist narratives. It presents the colonial victims as mere backdrops to the stories of white characters, implying that western expansion and the associated violence against non-white populations were nothing more than an inevitable byproduct of a heroic Western myth. Colonization is not only glossed over but its victims are systematically excluded from the narrative. In an era when engagement with colonial history and its lasting impacts is urgently needed, Godless fails to provide a critical examination and instead becomes another example of problematic handling of the history of the American West in popular culture.nnLast but least: While the series makes a promising start it increasingly feels like the script was written with chatgpt. It is well produced, but the story is often illogical and the characters are artificially filled with content.nnRadical movie critiques (RMC)",A,11/01/2025

This genre is still alive, and from time to time we can see short stories on VOD or hit or miss in cinema, here and there miniseries. I am glad this kind of movies are explored, but mostly we get something average. Peter Berg did a great miniseries involwing few characters, that try to survive in New Earth and in USA start new life. Those who know anything about that peroid of time, knows also that it was very harsh times, full of struggle and obstacles from nature and man. And American Primeval depicts this perfectly. With two flaws.nnFirst thig is that action, greatly directed and intense is packed in almost every inch of tape. I feel like writers compressed hundred years in one month.

rw10254521,tt12789558,Belfast (2021),"When I first saw the Oscar buzz for Kenneth Branagh's semi-autobiographical passion project my eyes rolled so hard they nearly detached from my brain. This is not the type of movie I typically enjoy very much. Everything from the trailer to the early reviews screamed that this would be toothache inducing, saccharine, schmaltz of the highest order. And there were moments of the film that it tiptoed dangerously close to that territory, but it thankfully never took the full plunge.nnI loved this movie, to my surprise. Every beat and joke and smirk and tear along the way was backed by immense joy and my reluctant respect. There is something to be said that maybe this was just the type of movie I needed right now. After two years of a long war against a seemingly endless virus, paired with a crop of films last year that, while great, were all unrelenting bummers, it just felt nice to feel nice. Branagh's film wraps us in a warm blanket and says ""forget about all that, aren't grandparents wonderful?"" ""Never mind all that pain and sadness, Ryan, look at what the power of song can do for heartache."" A movie about people being displaced due to the violent religious upheaval of 1960's Ireland should not count as escapist cinema, and yet here we are. And even more than that, it was therapeutic. It could be likened to that moment of serenity when someone turns off the vacuum cleaner. Your brain has adjusted to unpleasant sound and you no longer even realize it until it stops and that wave of pleasant tranquility comes rushing back. That is what seeing Belfast in the midst of all of this real world plight felt like to me.nnThe ensemble cast is all excellent, with Ciaran Hinds standing out as particularly natural, and the young Jude Hill as an absolute revelation. Critics of the film may say that it glosses over the real danger and complexity of the situation the characters were in, and it absolutely does. But it gets away with it because the story is told, and the movie cleverly shot, from the knee-high perspective of our adolescent lead. This movie isn't a deep analysis of ""The Troubles"" of Northern Ireland. That simply provides the backdrop and impetus of events of a film about family.nnBelfast a bracingly present and heartfelt excursion into the world and mind of these characters, as remembered by a filmmaker decades later. It's allowed to be glossy, as that is the power of memory. To carve out of the blustering clamor of life, a greater truth, spoken as a whisper.",A,11/01/2025
rw10254488,tt14724618,"""The Hack Job"" (2021)","""The Hack Job,"" an independent series spanning eight succinct episodes, merits detailed analysis for its adept balancing of comedic elements with action sequences and the depth of its narrative, which frequently defies the conventional tropes typically associated with this genre. This is not a series that relies on tired tropes, rather the show crafts a unique narrative that is as compelling as it is surprising. Upon close examination, the show reveals a nuanced understanding of character dynamics and technical proficiency in its visual and aural design.nnCharacter Studies Through Contrasting PersonalitiesnnThe series' core strength lies in the development of its characters, which are not merely vehicles for plot advancement but are instead thoughtfully constructed individuals with distinct quirks, fears, and motivations. Ken Hodges's portrayal of Bob is a masterclass in comedic performance. He navigates the show's chaotic world with a disarming mix of bravado and confusion, allowing his character to be both hilarious and somehow deeply relatable. Bob's reliance on ""code names"" and his hilarious attempts to justify his love of cheese despite his lactose intolerance serve as prime examples of the show's ability to generate humor from the absurdities of daily life.nnIn sharp contrast, Jessica Serfaty's Emily embodies a pragmatic and grounded character. Her controlled demeanor provides an essential anchor amidst the comedic chaos surrounding her, while still leaving room for a sense of relatability. Furthermore, Rachel Cook's portrayal of Megan brings an element of layered ambiguity to her character. Her calculated performance hints at a hidden past, and the contrast between her composed exterior and subtle flashes of vulnerability generates considerable intrigue. I believe this actor has serious potential as she matures. It is quite interesting that while three of the four main actors listed on the ""The Hack Job"" IMDb page, Jessica Serfaty, Ken Hodges, and Rachel Cook, play major roles in every episode, the fourth, Kyle Lewis, plays a more prominent part in certain episodes, which allows each actor to really shine within the context of their character, without having to be present all the time.nnOther supporting characters, such as Tim Willis's ""Mr. Smith"" and Dak Navarro's Remon, add depth to the series and provide more unexpected comedic moments. The show benefits from a variety of actors that are all perfect in their roles and who play off each other as if they've been working together for years. They are also actors that haven't had that ""big"" break that so many others have, and that dedication and love for the work truly elevates what they're doing. Furthermore, the frequent references to each character's personal ticks, mannerisms and preferences give each one a feeling of being a whole person.nnA Narrative Structure Embracing Subversion and Creative Freedomnn""The Hack Job"" effectively utilizes its unconventional 8-episode format to drive its plot forward with speed and innovation. The series eschews traditional narrative pacing, instead opting for an accelerated storytelling style, as is exemplified in episode 3's ""Walking the Dog"", where a supposedly simple first date evolves into a complex flashback of a mission. This type of dynamic storytelling is a core element of ""The Hack Job"" as it uses narrative tension to build moments of intense and unexpected comedic delight. For example, the ""prayer"" scene in Episode 5, encapsulates the show's ability to blend heartfelt expressions with moments of absurdist humor. Also, the character, Bob, has a moment of ""Eureka"" that is a clear demonstration of the show's ability to elicit laughs from the improbable. The consistent tension throughout each episode and the use of flashbacks to inform character history adds to the richness of the overall narrative.nnThe independent nature of ""The Hack Job"" is more than a production detail; it's the essence of its charm. Freed from the constraints of mainstream studio expectations, the series presents itself with a unique visual identity, a pacing and structure that challenges and rewards the audience, and a narrative style that is fresh and vibrant. Instead of trying to hide from the limitations of a small budget, the creators embrace and incorporate this, using it as a strength to add to the show's unique and memorable quality.nnTechnical Merit and the Blurring of GenrennFrom a technical perspective, the series shows great creative innovation. Cinematography, credited to JC Tremblay, demonstrates an impressive range of visual techniques that create moods and visual styles that help propel the series through each episode. There's an interesting contrast between scenes in brightly lit kitchens and dimly lit warehouses, to moments of wide landscape and close ups, which speaks to a real command of the language of film. In addition, the series uses sound, including the musical contributions of Drew Smith, to carefully enhance the tone of each scene, and it seamlessly intertwines with the narrative, creating an aural tapestry as dynamic as the visuals. The editing of each episode is paced effectively to push through to each emotional beat, be it comedic or something more genuine.nnAddressing Potential Criticisms from a Critical Perspective:nnWhile some might be quick to criticize certain aspects of this series, these critiques often fail to account for the show's narrative intent, and instead fall short of accurately portraying the series' true intentions.nnThe Claim of Inconsistent Production Values: Some will label this as a ""low-budget production,"" and say that they can see the strings, but to do that is to completely miss what makes this show work. It's low budget, yes, but what makes the show enjoyable is that it's the heart, the inventiveness and imagination that come from the limitations, that truly makes this series something special.nnThe Argument of ""Bad Acting"": In actuality, the series is filled with unique performances that use comedic elements and timing in such a creative manner, and it's their individuality that makes the show shine. This isn't ""bad"" acting; it's intentional, and the performances highlight the quirks that make these characters feel so real and likeable. The actors are all clearly talented, especially the core characters of Bob, Emily, and Megan, and they shine even within the short episode structure.nnComedy and Tension: Episode 3 highlights a scene where a character is told to put his hands in the air and is completely out of step with the typical tone of a tense action scene, but it's the juxtaposition of the danger and absurd humour that elevates the show to another level, forcing the audience to consider the relationship between tension and comedy.nnFinal Analysisnn""The Hack Job"" transcends the limitations of its independent production and presents something that is truly innovative and compelling. By taking chances with its quick-paced plot, and its characters that are a mishmash of bizarre quirks, along with the inventive cinematography, editing and sound design, the show sets a new standard of what independent series can accomplish. And because it is an original and inventive narrative, I have little doubt that it will soon have its own cult following.",A,11/01/2025

To be fair, I am an English-speaking person and only started getting into K-dramas last year, so I watched this entire series with closed captions. I liked the relationship between the main characters-yes, some parts were a little ""cheesy,"" but overall, I thought their relationship was cute. I even found myself laughing at the villain, thinking, ""When is this guy going to die? He has more than nine lives!""nThe one part of the series I didn't like was the ending.

Watching it, I couldn't help but feel like the creators were working out old grievances against the jocks who made their lives miserable at 16. Admittedly, I got a good laugh out of the wildly over-the-top portrayal of the good-for-nothing Ken Doll-esque football players, who never seemed to take off their uniforms. I laughed not because I thought the depiction was incisive or accurate, but because I could easily see how an aggrieved high school lesbian would have such a distorted view of the popular athletes who seemed to reap all the social benefits of high school despite being dull, unfunny, meatheads.nnThe creators also got way out over their skis in the final act with the incredibly low-budget ""action"" sequence at the football field. I was hoping for a modicum of authenticity during this climax, but it looked like there were about 50 fans in the stands, no officials, and the opposing enemy football team arrived with no coaches or fans of their own... huh.nnIt was fun for me to see Marshawn Lynch in front of the camera, but he was definitely shoe-horned in.

rw10254394,tt7631058,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"" (2022)","It's incredible how nostalgia for the real Lord of the Rings can lead you to sit through this series, hoping to relive the magic... only to hit a wall of boredom head-on. The Rings of Power is like ordering a royal feast and being served a salad without dressing: bland, endless, and utterly depressing. Six storylines to follow? No thanks-this isn't a series, it's a marathon of endurance tests.nnWhere are the epic battles, the heroic deaths, and the spine-tingling dialogue, like Gandalf's showdown with the Balrog? Here, after 13 episodes, nothing has happened. They promise grand confrontations, and you end up watching characters chatter endlessly in settings that look like a 2002 RPG. The Grey Havens? More like the Grey Drizzle. Even the orcs seem bored.nnElrond, Galadriel, the dwarves, the discount hobbits, Isildur, Sauron... Stop. Too many subplots kill the story. Constantly switching between them leaves you lost and disengaged. Why bother investing if no character has enough depth or development to hold your attention?nnThe cities? Ikea villages. The landscapes? Less memorable than a Windows XP wallpaper. Pelargir looks like a forgotten truck stop town you pass on the highway. Where's the grandeur of Middle-earth? Even the Shire in the original movies had more charm than everything here combined.nnThe only moment I felt a flicker of excitement was Sauron's return with his orcs in episode one. A fleeting reminder of past greatness, quickly smothered by dull writing and flavorless plotlines. Not even the Dark Lord can save this empty shell of a series.nnThe Rings of Power is the anti-Lord of the Rings. No soul, no rhythm, no grandeur. Just an overdose of chatter and uninspired settings. If Tolkien saw this, he'd send a Balrog to burn it all down. In short, a series to avoid-unless you enjoy suffering like Gollum without his precious.",A,11/01/2025
rw10254376,tt1548850,"""Misfits"" (2009)","I watched the first season and a few episodes of the second season of Misfits, but I couldn't take it anymore. The writing is horrendous, and while the acting isn't entirely terrible, I'm left wondering who this series is even meant for. Marketed as +18, it manages to be both ridiculously childish and quite harmful.nnThe premise of magical thunderstorms granting superpowers based on desires is intriguing, yet the execution is baffling. In a city where people are dying and disappearing, no one seems to notice or care-especially not the police. It's frustrating that the characters operate in a vacuum, with no one outside the main storyline in sight.nnThe characters are obnoxious, making one poor decision after another with their powers. Instead of growth, we're treated to cringe-worthy moments that feel more creepy than comedic. The infamous Nathan is particularly grating, exhibiting an unchanging, arrogant attitude that many seem to adore for some reason. His crude, sexist jokes and objectification of women are not just unfunny-they're genuinely disturbing. Lines like ""find a sweet, innocent girl and take advantage of her"" or wanting to have intimate relation with a 14 years old! Cross a line that shouldn't exist in entertainment.nnThere are too many plot holes, and the characters don't act like actual human beings-misfits or not. Instead of offering insightful commentary on youth culture, it devolves into a series of tasteless gags centered around genitals and objectification. Scenes featuring drugging others or stalking women under the guise of humor are not only ill-conceived but dangerously misguided.nnThe show had potential with its concept, but the obsession with sex and the juvenile humor detracts from any meaningful storytelling. The sex scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the plot, merely serving as fodder for immature fantasies. Overall, Misfits feels like a missed opportunity, overly focused on shock value rather than creating anything truly engaging or thought-provoking.",A,11/01/2025

The film was technically par with Hollywood and the standards set were brilliant. Mission Kashmir won the Filmfare for a lot of technical aspects, the vfx were great too, not an overdose and just the right amount. The climax is what makes the movie special. The climax of Mission Kashmir is one of the greatest in cinema history, you gotta watch it to accept it.

rw10254311,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"I don't ever feel compelled enough to write a review but Nosferatu is the odd occasion where I'll make an exception. I went to see in with low expectations as I always do with films these days but I was positively surprised - it was extraordinary, compelling and mesmerizing. We went to see it 1 January when it opened here in the UK. The cinema was unexpectedly packed for a matinee. I have never ever heard it so quiet. Nobody coughing, talking, eating noisy food, fidgeting in their seats - nothing - just stunned silence. This movie is truly captivating and transports you into another world. I have to add I have always been a huge fan of Murnau's 1922 original silent movie masterpiece, the only movie in fact to ever give me nightmares. Schreck's titular character was truly terrifying to me. So perhaps I was slightly biased going into this movie, however my expectations were low nevertheless, as as far as remakes go this movie - and Hollywood remakes in general - don't have a good track record.nnI was pleased to see that the German setting and different time period of the original were adhered to (rather than going back to the turn of the century standard template of the original Bram Stoker novel and having it all anglicised), Setting it in the earlier part of 19th century Germany was true genius and greatly aids the gothic and poetic feel of the movie. For example, due to the action taking place before there were trains, main character Hutter has to travel to Transylvania on horseback, even going on foot for the last part of the journey. Which automatically makes it more haunting and dangerous than a simple train journey, and we get to soak in the strange and beautiful scenery more. This was very clearly a labour of love by someone who did their research, understood the original and also had a background in German romanticism of the era during which it is set. The film effortlessly captures the sad, romantic and forlorn beauty of a Caspar David Friedrich painting, a Goethe poem or a Schubert song cycle (Winterreise springs to mind). The cinematography is the best I have ever seen in a horror movie, perhaps in any movie period. You could freeze frame every shot, print it out and hang it on your wall it's a work of art. I cannot use any term to describe it other than breathtaking.nnIn terms of the story and plot it keeps pretty close to the original with a few changes and additions each of which enriched and enhanced rather than took away. Brilliant performances by all in particular Hoult, Skarsgard and Dafoe. Overall though I must say the male performances were better than the females. Therein lies my only criticism of the movie. Throughout, Depp lacked expression in her eyes. However it has to be said, her character is in some kind of trance/ under Orlock's spell for large parts of it so this may have been the thinking behind the ""dead"" eyes. Skarsgard is spellbinding and terrifying as the revolting titular character, refreshingly and brilliantly hidden in the shadows for a lot of the movie. A true monster, the kind you were hiding under the bed from as a child. There are no glamorous, sophisticated, tragically misunderstood heartthrob vampires in this movie! No - he's just evil.nnTo enjoy the movie as much as I have, I think it does help to have a bit of context and background on the whole thing - so do watch the original 1922 silent movie and even the Herzog (1979) remake. Even though easily the weakest of the three Nosferatu films - it's still worth it for Klaus Kinski's usual unhinged and creepy yet mesmerizing brilliance alone. Also, Shadow of the Vampire (2000), which was about the making of the 1922 original, is a recommendation - very quirky, off the wall and unexpectedly humorous at times! It stars John Malkovich as Murnau and - coincidentally - also Dafoe who puts in a stunning performance as Schreck. Anyway, forget all the other Dracula movies like the over-the-top camp Hammer horrors or the bombastic Coppola epic - this isn't anything like those films. This is something entirely different. But for those of you that love the original and all things gothic horror - this is a real treat! And if you are planning on ever seeing please go now and watch it on the big screen - it won't be the same on the small screen.",A,11/01/2025
rw10254271,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"The one good thing about this movie is Selena Gomez. Her charisma and performance bring some life to an otherwise disappointing film. Though maybe I'm just biased as a Rare Beauty fan who's also seen her Disney days. However, even she cannot salvage this mess. The movie fails to represent Mexican culture or transsexuality in a genuine or respectful way, which is a major letdown considering they're the main two themes. The songs are awful, too - they feel awkward and disjointed, almost as if they were clumsily translated without much thought to flow or meaning, and they're downright unpleasant to listen to, so if I could skip them I would. The plot had some promise, but poor execution, shallow character development, and cultural inaccuracies make the entire experience fall apart.

Her performance is reminiscent of a 1970s-era Pam Grier, and she owns every scene she's in.nnThe film's tone is decidedly campy, with a healthy dose of humor and wit. The dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, and the situations Momma Sykes finds herself in are frequently absurd.nnOne of the standout aspects of ""See China and Die"" is its commentary on social issues. The film touches on themes such as racism, sexism, and classism, but does so in a way that's more playful than preachy.nnWhile the film's production values are somewhat dated, the cinematography is still impressive, capturing the gritty realism of 1980s New York City.nnOverall, ""See China and Die"" is a deliciously campy mystery film that's sure to entertain.

rw10254255,tt0049828,Ori okeanis saidumloeba (1957),"The film is adapted from Ukrainian writer Grigori Adamov's 1939 novel of the same name. Directed by Georgian filmmaker Konstantin Pipinashvili, the film was shot in Georgia, then a part of the Soviet Union. While this movie is often credited with kickstarting the second wave of science fiction films in Soviet cinema, its original title and most of the surviving records about it are in Georgian, not Russian. Unfortunately, due to the lack of archival awareness in Georgia, very little remains from the film itself or its production notes.nnThe film deviates significantly from the book, restructured with numerous additions to serve as a vehicle for heavy Soviet propaganda.nnIn literature and cinema, fantastical fiction, while not explicitly encouraged in the early Soviet period, was at least not prohibited. During the 1920s, before dictator Josef Stalin began perceiving science fiction and fantasy as subversive, Russia produced a handful of experimental and intriguing science fiction films. However, apart from a few carefully monitored propaganda films, there was virtually no science fiction output from the Eastern Bloc in the 1930s and 1940s. It is no coincidence that the resurgence of Russian science fiction on screen began after the dictator's death in 1953. In 1956 and 1957, two ocean-themed science fiction films were released: Tayna vechnoy nochi (The Mystery of the Eternal Night, 1956) and this one.nnThe visual effects in this film are abysmal; rear projection was used for backgrounds, but even this was executed poorly.nnIn comparison, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, released three years earlier, handled these elements with remarkable precision.nnOne might wonder, ""Were the USSR and the US producing similar works despite the Cold War?"" Indeed, Soviet filmmakers could import high-quality Eastmancolor film stock from the US for certain high-profile projects. However, it seems unlikely that this film utilized such material, opting instead for the Sovcolor system, which, while popular in the USSR at the time, had poor color fidelity and resulted in visually taxing imagery.nnCreating the IMDb and Wikipedia pages for this film was particularly challenging. The Ukrainian and Russian entries were riddled with repetitive inaccuracies, while the Georgians had contributed virtually nothing to online platforms.nnIt is truly heartbreaking to witness the disappearance of certain films into obscurity.",A,11/01/2025
rw10254245,tt18259086,Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024),"Back when I was younger, I didn't really care much about Sonic. In fact, I didn't really like it that much, thinking it was kind of silly. But after I saw the first movie, my opinion changed completely. I saw the potential the franchise had to be one of the best in history, and if it had so many failures, it was because SEGA didn't see what could be done. But the first movie came along; right after that, Sonic took off again and was everywhere. Then came the second one; much better than the previous one, it took everything that was good and tripled the quality. Now I'm faced with the third one, and I go to the movies with the same joy I had four years ago. And I'm not disappointed.nnSonic 3 is probably one of the best movies of the year, with visual effects so realistic that they are better than Marvel movies, my favorite artist, Tyson Hesse being the best co-producer/storyboard artist/character designer possible, Jim Carrey simply being the best villain in history, and of course, Keanu Reeves gave a show as Shadow, making him easily one of the best characters in the history of cinema. The other actors and voice actors do a good job, with highlights for Ben, Colleen and Idris who rocked as Sonic, Tails and Knuckles respectively and Alyla Browne who was perfect as Maria. If you want a movie to have fun, get emotional and leave the theater with a smile on your face, this is the movie for you. And please, stay until the end: the two post-credit scenes are spine-chilling. And that's why I say: SEGA finally opened its eyes, its mind and showed that it can, indeed, surprise.",A,11/01/2025

Goosebumps Season 2 had a solid start, and Season 1 isn't all bad, ranging from good to middling in My personal opinion. But this felt like the movie version, the high school back In 2016, this feels like a follow-up.nnThe scary scenes are genuinely creepy and disturbing, it really has you on your feet, or toes. And may I add, the Hauntingly dark rooms makes the tension and atmosphere scary and more crisp and intense. The unsettling vibe makes it a breeze to watch, the doings and the unfoldings of the scenes really hook you for the next part. I enjoyed these scenes as they did add the darkness, but also the mystery that will be followed up. I enjoyed the re-grouoing of things. It feels like classic Horror.nnAlthough the lighting needs to be toned down, after all it was too dark in some scenes you couldn't identify what was going on. And that was ashame, but the story and darkness does add to the scary elements so that's why it's also a good thing. The purple effect for the basement scene was georgoes and the set designs were really pleasing on the eyes.nnI like the kids in groups, it adds some scenes and the Chemistry we feel is their. They feel very fresh, like modern day kids using terms such as ""Tiktok"" and other things like talking about their past with each other. It's a unique and nice way to bring Goosebumps into the 20th Century. The acting wasn't that bad either, no standouts as of yet. But the stereotypes are abit duller. But other then that some goods came out of it.nnThe story offered dark imagery too, but the Basement scene looked cool, the action piece was perfected, and seemed scary too see what the sticky plant was doing. I feel like they could've added it in sooner to add in the scares and make the mystery more gripping, because the scenes we did get was genuinely quite dark.nnThe end scene was also very good, whilst the line-of-dialogue didn't create anything for me, the other scene really lifted my excitement and entertainment for the next chapter installed in the story. I feel like they could of shown or explained the scenes of the story, like how did the Uncle or kids dissappear. But like I said, It is a mystery and it has hooked me to find out this key-factor 🗝, see what I did their.nnI'd rate this a 6, because I think my positives and the negatives really lifted or ruined some of the scenes and I think my criticisms were fair, I enjoyed it and I can't wait for the next episodes.",A,11/01/2025

But I suppose the question answers itself. There are almost no production costs. Unknowns working with lousy writers and no-talent cinematographers. The final clue of ""An Angry Boy's"" hopelessness is the casting of Eric Roberts, a study on how much a career can deteriorate and still be functional at the lowest levels. And here, in fairness, I want to acknowledge his comedic work as the aged and wildly libidinous stalking doctor on those bizarre productions. For a paycheck I couldn't have done any better myself. Eric has 3 minutes of screen time here and that's where the whole budget went. The story line is about a male pedophilic cult (Eric's sexuality is now panoramic, global) that kidnaps young boys, rendered as capons if they disobey, one of whom escapes, and is tracked down some ten years later by the murderous founder's partner. Going in you should know that the star of this thing is the large log, honed to a razor sharp apex, which male victims are compelled to straddle spread eagled with buckets tied to their ankles, which are gradually filled with bricks until the desired result is achieved, the spatchcocking (look it up) of the sorry young victim.

As they sort through their father's belongings, they stumble upon a series of cryptic letters and recordings that reveal a dark family secret: their father's involvement in a tragic event that has haunted their family for decades.nnAs the brothers dig deeper into their family's history, they begin to unravel a complex web of lies, deceit, and silence. Through a non-linear narrative, Lie expertly juxtaposes the present-day investigation with flashbacks of the brothers' childhood, slowly revealing the traumatic events that have shaped their lives.nnThe performances by Mestad and Kristensen are outstanding, conveying the depth of their characters' emotional pain and vulnerability. The supporting cast, including Line Verndal as the brothers' mother, adds to the film's emotional intensity.nnCinematographer Martin Solvang's use of muted colors and stark landscapes effectively captures the bleakness and isolation of the Norwegian countryside, mirroring the characters' emotional states.

(#1.744)}","The most touching moment in the Dressrosa Arc is the poignant admission by Fujitora that he wanted to see Luffy's face. There was so much weight in that statement because it meant he respected what Luffy had done and stood for. For a man who has blindfolded himself to avoid looking at the ugliness of the world, this intent to see the face of Luffy speaks volumes regarding the impact which Luffy has managed to have upon him.

rw10254034,tt15041836,Werewolves (2024),"If you're interested in a poorly stitched together patchwork quilt-style film that pays homage to many great horror classics without matching their quality, you might enjoy this film. It's like they took visual, narrative, and conceptual snippets from far superior horror films and threw them together under the assumption that the best parts of a bunch of awesome films would inevitably equal one stellar film. It didn't. There are continuity issues, ""smart"" characters who make the dumbest decisions possible, blaringly obvious methods to better manage the situation introduced but glossed over multiple times, some weird werewolf rendering, and many other issues that make this movie feel like a ride on a jerky wooden roller coaster that should be decommissioned because it causes whiplash.nnOn the positive side, this movie made me laugh, laugh, and laugh some more.

There are a lot of unexplained or glanced over plot-holes, you kind of need to turn your brain off for this one and just enjoy the ass-kicking and ridiculous foolery. Boy Kills World may seem like an inclusive feature, but underneath the admittedly fun carnage is a feeble attempt at genuine representation.

Every woman with a speaking line has an on-screen sex scene and the heroine lacks agency throughout.nnThis lack of agency could have been played as a powerful allegory to the dangers of toxic relationships, especially when tied to her relationship to Orlok, but instead it ends up reading simply as the female characters being nothing more than sex objectsnnLikewise, many of the characters felt lacking in any depth, you never had the impression that their actions were being driven by their own motives or personalities, you were just expected to accept that they were doing what they were doing because the plot required it.nnHaving spent three quarters of the film convinced I was watching the best vampire film I'd ever seen, it was so much more disappointing to find the completed story so hollow.

rw10253991,tt21823606,A Real Pain (2024),"POSITIVES:nn1) Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin both give incredible performances and really carry this film on their backs. Culkin seems to be the one getting most of the awards attention, and I can completely understand why, but I'd actually like to highlight Eisenberg as the better performance of the two in my opinion. Culkin spends the entire film loud and emotional, whereas Eisenberg only has two scenes where gets emotional (in the restaurant and on the rooftop) and those are the two best scenes in the film for me.nn2) I don't think the narrative is exactly reinventing the wheel, but I do fundamentally think the writing of the story between these two men is done well. They're both very flawed and incomplete individuals who really are the opposite sides of the coin to each other, yet there's a clearly a deep love between the two of them. However, despite this, they still have to part ways at the end of the film and ultimately revert back to being the characters that they were at the start. The ""real pain"" of the title seems to me to be the pain of accepting that your life is what it is, when you have this person opposite you who clearly represents the road untraveled for you. The final shot at the end of Culkin sat back in the airport, just like how we saw him at the start, and desperately looking round to try and find some sort of human connection from someone, was really tragic and embodied that sense of the character now being trapped in this life that he's chosen for himself.nn3) The film is a really good example to me of films that I wish there were more of in the industry. It's a low budget, short 90 minute film. It has very unflashy cinematography and direction, that just tells its story in a very straightforward way without the need for any grand spectacle, and really relies on its writing and its performances rather than any flashy visuals or effects. The film had me feeling like I was actually on a trip in Poland and, like any good trip, it didn't last too long or overstay its welcome.nnNEGATIVES:nn1) Outside of Culkin and Eisenberg, nobody else really does anything of note at all and I actually found the rest of characters in their tour group to be quite annoying and painfully surface level.nn2) I definitely can't say that I enjoyed watching the film for large parts. I have a low bar for cringe and so I found this film excruciating to watch at times when it came to Culkin's character. The idea of being trapped on a tour group with this guy would kill me. He's so whiny and annoying and uncomfortable and I really really hated his character, rather than feeling sympathetic for him like I feel as though the film wanted.nn3) I think the film is very bland and pedestrian at times and I can't imagine it'll stay with me very long. I think this'll be a film where I look back at my IMDb reviews for the year of 2025 and have to jog my memory about this film when I come across it in my reviews. For a film that has the holocaust in its subject matter, I always felt like this was in the background rather than something that the film actually wanted to focus on. There's that one scene at the concentration camp where it's really powerful and harrowing, but that scene just felt out of place with the rest of the film and didn't gel at all.",A,11/01/2025

The seemingly tedious process of building up a storyline takes up a decent portion of the movie, but from then onwards, it's a roller-coaster ride. However, in this film, the slow start and confusing build-up is instrumental to its brilliance and is more than made up for by an ending that manages to astonish and leave you at a loss for words.

rw10253956,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Business executive ""Romy"" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with the dog-handling skills of ""Samuel"" (Harris Dickinson) but when she discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that though happily enough married to ""Jacob"" (Antonio Banderas) she's not exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and ""Samuel"" seems to sense that it's an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking sex, here - oh. No. This is about a lady with fantasy of being dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you're going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn't really work. Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do, simultaneously, here. Indeed I'm sure I saw his black Calvin's shining from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest. I didn't need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn't get it. It's filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there's no attempt to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I felt like this was little better than a titillation for it's stars that didn't really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related porn might. Dickinson isn't remotely charismatic and the premiss falls flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of ""Esme"" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing up.

An absolute mess of what could have been an amazing cinematic experience. Crowe was the only decent actor in the movie.

Not sure how Johnson is going to pull off the role of James Bond? This movie is like a most anticipated sports car debut (thanks to months of marketing) that takes off the starting line and almost immediately loses acceleration and continues to leak fluids and parts before it falls flat.

The movie stars Maisy Stella, Percy Hynes White, Maddie Ziegler, Kerrice Brooks, and Aubrey Plaza ¹.nnThe plot follows Elliott, an 18-year-old girl who encounters her 39-year-old self during a mushroom trip. Her older self starts handing out warnings about what her younger self should and shouldn't do, making Elliott rethink everything about family, love, and her future ¹.nnGreetings again from the darkness. Eighteen-year-old Elliott is counting down the twenty-two days remaining until she leaves home for her freshman year of college. For anyone who was once 18 or has raised an 18-year-old, you know that 22 days is the future. Writer-director Megan Park follows up her excellent feature film debut, THE FALLOUT (2021), with a different tone, albeit another one that focuses on the stress of being a teenager.nnMaisy Stella landed the role of Daphne on the series ""Nashville"" at a very young age, and even got to sing on the show with her sister Lennon. Her role as Elliott is her feature film debut, and she proves to be quite charming in front of the camera, with a nice screen presence. A camping trip with her friends Ro (Kerrice Brooks) and Ruthie (Maddie Ziegler) leads to a trip on mushrooms that has the friends hallucinating, while something altogether more extreme happens with Elliott. Coming face-to-face with one's future self while sitting on a log in the woods can only be described as fantastical.nnAubrey Plaza plays from-the-future thirty-nine-year-old (not 40!) Elliott, and though she doesn't have much screen time, her trademark snark fits well, and the scenes with both Elliotts are quite fun. However, this isn't the typical Hollywood body swap/share. The cool twist is that the situation allows for the age-old unsolvable dilemma: what advice would your older self give your younger self if that were possible? While attempting to walk a fine line, the wisdom passed along includes be nice to your mom and your family, and understand that ""time goes by so fast"". One final bit of counseling involves 'avoiding Chad'. At this point, young Elliott had no idea who Chad is or why she should avoid, but of course, she finds out quickly.nnChad (Percy Hynes-White, ""Wednesday"") turns out to be a college student working on the family cranberry farm. He's also exceedingly nice and Elliott struggles mightily against falling hard for him. Yes, this is the same Elliott who we've seen in intimate situations with local barista Chelsea (Alexandria Rivera). At its core, this is a contemporary story where a teenager is searching for identity and meaning. Other supporting cast members include Maria Dizzia as mom, Al Goulem as dad, and Seth Isaac-Johnson and Carter Trozzolo as Elliott's brothers - one addicted to golf, the other obsessed with actress Saoirse Ronan (complete with a funny visual).nnSome cliches are almost necessary in this type of story, but a mushroom trip featuring a Justin Bieber sequence to ""One Less Lonely Girl"" is both funny and creative. Offering advice to one's younger self in an attempt to save her from pain is understandable, but can we figure out life at age 18 even if we cheat and get input from our 'middle-aged' self? In fact, what filmmaker Park has done is create a dual coming of age story - one for teens and one for adults.

And I agree, it's all those things, however there is one thing that bugs me.nnThe main villain. I think Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) is a great villain....but not enough cruel and calculated. (small spoiler?) There is a certain scene towards the end where you can see he shows a sort of emotional weakness, and it's not anger, but a feeling of inferiority. I would've liked he remained this kind of unapologetic, mostly, one-dimensional villain. He has the looks, he has the attitude, just wished they didn't include that scene, or made him more poker faced.",A,11/01/2025

This movie clearly shows that sometimes, cinema transcends mere storytelling and touches the core of human emotions.nnThe film's narrative flows seamlessly, drawing you into a world of warmth, regret, and bittersweet nostalgia. Its tear-jerking moments are not forced but arise naturally from the authentic connections between the characters. The actors are incredible, & the way Bilkin has lived the character M, it leaves you spellbound. Every scene feels like a quiet reminder of the love we take for granted until it's too late.nnWhat truly stands out is how the movie never tries to be grandiose. Its simplicity is its strength, with every moment, every glance, and every unspoken word carrying profound weight.nnThis film is a cinematic gem, both heart-wrenching and healing. It reminds us that sometimes the most impactful stories are not the loudest but the ones that whisper truths we need to hear.nnA must-watch for anyone who values family, love, and the fleeting beauty of time.",A,11/01/2025

rw10253791,tt13016388,"""3 Body Problem"" (2024)","The characters are the heart of the series. Ye Wenjie, portrayed with haunting brilliance, is both a victim and a catalyst. Her decisions, shaped by personal trauma and disillusionment with humanity, resonate deeply. Wang Miao, the nanotech scientist drawn into a mysterious VR game called Three Body, serves as our entry point into this perplexing and fascinating world. His journey from skepticism to awe mirrors what we, as viewers, experience.nnWhat's remarkable is how the series treats its characters with nuance. They're not just heroes or villains-they're flawed, conflicted, and achingly human. This depth adds emotional weight to the high-stakes narrative, making every revelation and twist hit harder.nnVisuals That Redefine Sci-FinLet's talk about the visuals, because wow. The series doesn't just depict a dystopian future or alien world-it immerses you in it. The depiction of the chaotic Trisolaran system is breathtaking, with its three suns creating an ever-shifting landscape of beauty and destruction. The VR game sequences are equally stunning, blending surrealism with scientific precision to create something that feels entirely new.nnIt's clear that the creators spared no expense in bringing Liu Cixin's vision to life. The attention to detail is staggering, whether it's the design of the Trisolaran technology, the eerie beauty of their communication methods, or the way Earth itself is rendered in moments of crisis.nnThemes That Stay With YounWhat sets The Three-Body Problem apart is its intellectual depth. This isn't just a story about aliens-it's a story about us. It asks hard questions about human nature, the cost of progress, and our place in the cosmos. Are we, as a species, capable of uniting against a common threat? Or are our divisions and flaws too deeply ingrained?nnThe series also explores the concept of hope and despair in fascinating ways. The Trisolarans' desperate search for survival mirrors our own struggles as a species, creating a sense of empathy even as they pose a threat to humanity.nnWhy You Need to Watch ItnIf you're someone who loves stories that challenge your mind and stir your soul, The Three-Body Problem is a must-watch. It's not just a show-it's an experience. It pushes the boundaries of what science fiction can achieve, blending mind-blowing concepts with deeply emotional storytelling.nnThis series has left me in awe. As someone who loves diving into stories that make you think and feel, I can't recommend it enough. The Three-Body Problem isn't just another sci-fi series-it's a masterpiece that deserves to be seen, discussed, and celebrated.",A,11/01/2025
rw10253777,tt14209618,Game Changer (2025/I),"Shankar is undeniably a legendary director. He was a pioneer in creating pan-Indian films long before the term became popular. Not only did he helm high-budget movies with big stars, but with films like Boys and Premikudu, he proved he could deliver blockbusters even without major star power. Unfortunately, that golden era seems to have faded. Especially after the controversies surrounding Indian 2, his reputation has taken a hit. Naturally, when he announced Game Changer, skepticism was high. Many wondered if he could recreate his old magic. However, with Ram Charan, Chiranjeevi, and Dil Raju onboard-each a heavyweight in their own right-it wasn't just Shankar's movie anymore. Even so, the negative sentiment surrounding the project seemed to impact its opening.nnAfter watching the movie, I can see why Ram Charan and the others believed in its potential. Appanna's character is a standout and might just be one of the most memorable roles in Ram Charan's career. Years down the line, when he reflects on his filmography, this will likely be one of the highlights. The character even reminded me of The King's Speech-perhaps it served as an inspiration.nnThe first half of the film is engaging, barring the introduction song after the initial fight, which felt routine. Beyond that, the first half works well, capped off by an unpredictable interval twist. There are also some dialogues explaining the role and powers of a district collector, and Burra Sai Madhav's writing truly shines here. It's reminiscent of that iconic scene in Rakhi where NTR passionately explains the importance of Indian Railways. Post-interval, the flashback sequence of Appanna's character is a major highlight. This is where vintage Shankar resurfaces, and Ram Charan delivers a stellar performance.nnHowever, after this flashback, the second half becomes somewhat predictable. The political drama echoes Tamil Nadu's election dynamics, drawing parallels to the DMK and Anna DMK parties. Unfortunately, the writing falters here, lacking the freshness or impact of the first half. I suspect many viewers might find the latter portion underwhelming.nnIn terms of performances, Ram Charan gets plenty of scope to explore various shades, and he does a commendable job. Personally, I preferred his look with a beard-it suits him better. Surya performs well but veers into overacting in a few scenes. It was refreshing to see Srikanth in this role, and he did justice to it. The heroine, sadly, doesn't get much screen time or substance, while the rest of the cast delivered solid performances. Thaman's music is a notable positive, offering some refreshing compositions that enhance the film in many parts.nnOverall, Game Changer is worth watching for its strong first half and the flashback episodes. However, the routine and predictable second half may dampen its box-office prospects.",A,11/01/2025

The chemistry between Plaza and the young actress playing Elliott is palpable, creating a believable and engaging dynamic.nnWhile some may find the premise far-fetched, the film's grounded approach and relatable characters make it easy to suspend disbelief. The humor is witty and often unexpected, and the emotional moments are genuine and touching.nnOverall, ""My Old Ass"" is a refreshing and entertaining film that offers a unique perspective on the complexities of growing up.

The ONLY positive thing is that this time they actually allowed hispanic actors to play central roles. Pedro and Paul delivered amazing performances, but these two couldnt pull this movie up from the secondary level.nnBiggest weakness of this movie is that it is written, created, directed, acted - entirely by men and about men. Women are allowed 2-3 roles as wives and mothers. There are also some (very few) servants and concubines, thank you very much. The whole thing is loud and flat, full of testosterone dreams and completely unwatchable.nnMescal humanizes this nonsence a lot, the admiration for his acting kept me in front of the screen, he was a pure gold of this movie, but the rest - just sad.

The movie tries hard to blend dark humor with intense drama, but it ultimately falls flat.nnFirst off, the pacing is all over the place. Some scenes drag on for what feels like an eternity while others feel rushed and disjointed. It's like Quentin Tarantino couldn't decide if he wanted to tell a serious story or just throw in random quips and violence for shock value.nnBrad Pitt's performance as Lt. Aldo Raine comes across as cartoonish rather than compelling. His character feels more like a caricature than a fully fleshed-out individual, which detracts from any real emotional engagement with the story.nnAdditionally, the film's portrayal of history is problematic at best. While Tarantino's alternate take on WWII could have been an interesting concept, it often feels disrespectful rather than thought-provoking. The glorification of violence in this context is unsettling and leaves you wondering what message is truly being conveyed.nnVisually stunning? Sure! But substance matters too, and sadly this film lacks depth. What could have been a gripping narrative about revenge becomes a convoluted mess that overstays its welcome.nnIn summary, ""Inglourious Basterds"" did not live up to its reputation for me-it felt more like style over substance without delivering anything meaningful or memorable in return.

The characters are multidimensional and relatable, with flaws and quirks that make them feel endearingly human.nnThe cinematography is stunning, with a vibrant color palette that adds to the film's offbeat charm. The pacing is well-balanced, oscillating between moments of poignant introspection and laugh-out-loud humor.nnWhat truly sets ""My Odd Ass"" apart, however, is its unwavering commitment to individuality. This film is an ode to the misfits, the outcasts, and the eccentrics who refuse to be bound by societal norms.nnOverall, ""My Odd Ass"" is a cinematic gem that will resonate with anyone who's ever felt like they don't quite fit in.

rw10253700,tt27679608,Fateh (2025),"Sonu Sood's directorial debut, Fateh, is an action flick that delivers on the action front but suffers from a tiring, uninteresting, and predictable screenplay. The film incorporates many elements reminiscent of movies like Equalizer and Animal. While the action choreography stands out, the blood CGI is noticeably poor. The camerawork is good, but the editing turns out to be bad. The songs are decent, and although the background score is good, it seems to be misplaced in many scenes, failing to elevate the intended moments. The film tries hard to be a ""cool"" and invincible spectacle where a man goes on a killing spree, but it ends up feeling very wannabe.nnSonu Sood gives his all to the role and looks convincing in the action sequences. Jacqueline's character and subplot feel very cliché. Naseeruddin Shah is wasted, while Vijay Raaz steals the show with his stellar dialogue delivery, standing out as the most memorable part of the film. The rest of the supporting cast is just average.

And I've never watched a war movie that uses rock and roll music as its soundtrack, as this one does. And I love all the soundtracks.nnI found it very wired the first time I saw it, but I began to find it so intriguing the second time that I watched it several times. The first half is incredibly phenomenal! So many scenes are iconic! And the second half affords much food for thought. Whether it's the fact that the Joker wears a peace button on his uniform and writes ""Born to kill"" on his helmet, believing that men are of duality, or that the banner reads ""First to go, last to know. We will defend to the death your right to be misinformed"", this half has a sobering taste of irony. Of course, the whole film is full of irony and elements of brainwashing. I think Kubrick was suggesting that the Big tried to convince the public of what it wanted them to believe, by trickery or swindle.

rw10253562,tt30068040,"""El Secreto del Río"" (2024)","Where do I begin? First of all, this show introduced me to a whole different aspect of indigenous Mexican culture that I never knew about. I find indigenous culture to be so beautiful and fascinating, yet there's a sense of superiority with the people of Spanish descent in Mexico, including in my family, so I don't have as much knowledge or experience. It's a shame because indigenous culture is so much more free, colorful, and interesting!! Also, sexuality and gender identity was always so fluid in so many civilizations throughout history, until the rise of Catholicism where it was seen as ""unholy,"" even though God the Father and God the Son use He/Him but God the Holy Spirit uses She/Her so the Holy Trinity Itself is gender fluid... but I digress. My point is, it's a shame that this specific story has to exist the way it does in this world we live in, and that the culture and the people represented are so unknown and taboo, but it's also amazing that it exists and that we get to see it and learn from it.nnAnyways, there is a difference between learning about a culture, and meeting the souls of people within one. Manuelito was so authentic, so confident, and so pure. So was Solange, and all of the other muxes. They made life so much brighter, so much more colorful, so much fun!nnBut although they are the context, this isn't a story about muxes; this is a story about the relationship between Manuelito (who, in fact, has always been Sicarú), and Erik. There are very few examples I've seen of a bond like these two (Luca is one tho ;)). The actors were just brilliant!! I was so absorbed in how their friendship was developing in the first four episodes, my heart was beating along with theirs. They had such a pure connection and bond, where it seemed the only people they could truly be themselves around was each other, and nobody else knew them the way they knew eachother. And they became one when they made the pact in blood.nnBut then there was the tragedy of the people around them full of hate and bigotry, using their wickedness to separate them and make them suffer, because they were so scared of such pure, true love. It's the fear and self-loathing that people have within themselves that drives them to hate and shame those around them, and that fear comes from people who hated and shamed them in their past. And it's one of the reasons our world is so broken. The last five episodes were honestly gut-wrenching. Seeing how their lives developed separately, and seeing how difficult it was for them to come together again and get to know each other twenty years later. The actors of the adult versions were also brilliant!!nnI think what was so heartbreaking for me was that Erik and Sicarú were soulmates, they were one, but they were then separated by a cruel world, and they had to find their place in that cruel world. My point of view might be very different from others, but your soulmate is your best friend, and a best friend is true love, and your best friend and soulmate is always worth more than a thousand lovers. Of course they found their own happiness apart from each other, but I can't help but think how differently things would have turned out if Erik's dad hadn't called Manuelito's dad, and if they would've stayed together. But alas, that wasn't their destiny in this world. And my heart breaks to see that pure and true connection broken and lost, even if it is regained in a different way at a different time. Nothing else was as pure or as true. It hurts to think about what might have been.nnSeriously, 10/10, an absolute masterpiece that will make you think and break your heart.",A,11/01/2025

Decision to Leave is a hypnotic slow burn neo-noir crime story from legendary Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook. My love for Park's work is well established in this space, as Oldboy is one of my favorite films of all time and when Bong Joon Ho took home Best Director and Best Picture Oscars in 2020 for Parasite, I was gleeful, but quick to remind that he still wasn't Korea's best filmmaker.nnDecision to Leave is the special kind of film that sublimates the information it relays to you. We see more than what we are shown. The film is seductive, despite depicting very little sex or skin. It is morbid despite showing very little gore or violence. Which is perfect because a great deal of this film is more about what we feel versus what we perceive. How our emotions manipulate our senses and disguise otherwise clear truths.nnDecision to Leave is considered a neo-noir mostly on the back of its inventive and modern cinematography, but this is firmly nestled within conventional noir. It's bleak and pessimistic, drenched through with brooding, the Femme Fatale is beguiling and menacing in equal measure, and it's got more twists than a silly straw. What is unique is that our hero detective is more beholden to his integrity than most in the genre, which unfortunately for him becomes his Achilles heel. The concessions he makes in the name of love, or obsession, or both (as the film beautifully illustrates how intertwined the two are), are a cost too great for him to bear.nnDecision to Leave would be a much lesser movie in any less capable hands because it is not about its plot. To shoot this movie as written without the subtext would make it altogether forgettable if not unrealistic and silly. The plot points are somewhat contrived, but they are there as a vessel of greater work being done. The investigations of the story are secondary to the investigation the film makes into our own psyches.nnWhat do we truly desire and why?nnWhen do we know when we are loved?nnWhere, and how, does an acquaintance pass into a more substantial object of affection in our lives? How do we reconcile such a person being at odds with everything we hold sacred and how can we forgive ourselves for putting ourselves in that position?nnGentle suggestions to these questions are posited but no answers are eminent when watching Decision to Leave, but that doesn't make them any less pertinent.

rw10253477,tt14230458,Poor Things (2023),"Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things is a Frankenstein story of sorts that follows the life of Bella, a dead woman reanimated with the brain of a child, as she sets out to explore the world and herself. It sets its sights on sexual liberation and takes to task the long-known but seldom discussed infatuation of men with infantile women. It explores how virginal virtue is an entrenched, inherently patriarchal device and the dexterous footing it requires of women to navigate their sexual independence without being considered morally repugnant... Did I mention it is unquestionably the funniest film of the year?nnIt takes these and several other heavy concepts and makes something that never considers itself precious. In Poor Things, a valid and prescient argument is never a good enough reason to pass up a good dick joke. Yorgos Lanthimos is one of my favorite filmmakers for this reason. His last film, The Favourite, topped my year end list in 2018. Both films tackle high concept with gamut-running humor, from the transcendent to the toilet and back again.nnEmma Stone is superb in giving us her best performance yet, and maybe the best of the entire year. We see Bella remain, largely, physically unchanged (outside of her literally toddling in the first part of the film), but grow exponentially cognitively and emotionally. Mark Ruffalo gives my favorite supporting turn of the year as the scoundrel bent on corrupting Bella, only to find himself unequal to the task. I am not exaggerating when I say I can't remember a single line he delivered that didn't at least draw a chuckle from me. He's one of the most hilariously deplorable characters in recent memory.nnThe production design, sets, costumes and visual effects create one of the most sumptuous visual experiences of the year. They are all superlative and could each win awards this season. The score is superb, and every frame of the movie is elegantly and exhaustingly detailed. It's prestige filmmaking for the dreggs, and it is perfect because of it.nnThis is the first book adaptation Lanthimos has ever made into film, which only surprised me because it feels like such a Lanthimos film. Like the Frankenstein concept the film borrows from, sometimes unfamiliar and unrelated material must come together to create something truly miraculous. Even with the difficult and potentially controversial subject matter, Poor Things is absolutely Lanthimos' most accessible film to date, and possibly his best. This was the most fun I had all year with a movie and simply needs to be experienced to be appreciated.",A,11/01/2025
rw10253433,tt3240302,Hot Chocolate (1942),"""Hot Chocolate"" is a short film that is a 'Soundie'...an early sort of music video that was played on specially built jukeboxes from 1940-1947. These jukeboxers were unusual because they not only played music but video...like music videos of the modern era. And, if you are curious about this an other soundies, you might want to buy yourself a copy of ""Soundies the Ultimate Collection""...a 4 disc set of about 200 of these films.nnIn this Soundie, Duke Ellington and His Orchestra play for a group called ""Whitey's Lindy Hoppers"". The Lindy Hop, by the way, was a dance much like the Jitterbug...very athletic and loved by the young (adults mostly saw this type of dancing as a sign of the coming apocalypse!). This Soundie is a bit unusual in that Basie credits one of his featured performers by name...folks you likely have never heard of and it might be one of the only times you can see and hear them.nnThe star of this one clearly are these amazing dancers. I doubt if I ever could have danced this well and this athletically and they are pretty amazing to watch....so much so that you barely notice the music!",A,11/01/2025

Sonu Sood, known for his action chops, couldn't elevate the dull and unengaging fight scenes.nnTo make matters worse, the movie's visuals and action sequences looked more like a PC or PS game than a cinematic experience.

rw10253401,tt13622970,Moana 2 (2024),"Vaiana is a sequel made only to bring viewers in theaters and gain easy money. The plot is awful as well as the new characters that are exasperating and stupid. The vilain is forgettable and the problem is that the menace he represents is not concrete at all. In the first one, their island was threatened notably because fruits became rotten. Here, there is no manifestation of the threat, it comes from nowhere. To finish, even the characters do not take it seriously. They constantly make jokes so I was never able to fear anything for Moana and her people. This movie is a failure, except the animation that is of course wonderful. I do not recommend. It adds nothing to the first one which was far far far better. We must stop giving money to Disney for lazy movies like this one or their useless live action remakes. When you look at Disney next animated movies schedule, it's only other sequels like Rapunzel 2, Zootopia 2, Frozen 3 etc. I won't go watch them in theater.

rw10253381,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"Nosferatu is a visually stunning homage to classic cinema, with its remarkable use of shadow techniques evoking the eerie beauty of the original Dracula film. The cinematography is a true work of art, blending light and darkness to create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that feels both vintage and timeless. The filmmakers clearly approached this retelling of the iconic vampire story with a deep appreciation for its gothic roots, and for the most part, their efforts pay off in delivering a chilling, atmospheric experience.nnThat said, the film is not without its flaws. One particularly strange choice was the inclusion of a sex scene between the main actress and her husband. While it seems intended to reflect her unraveling mental state, it feels out of place and unnecessary, adding confusion rather than depth to her character. The scene detracts from the mood of the film, breaking the spell of its otherwise carefully crafted tone.nnAnother missed opportunity was the underutilization of the vampire's regenerative abilities, a classic hallmark of the mythos. By failing to explore this aspect of the creature, the film strips Nosferatu of one of the most compelling elements of his menace and mystique. Additionally, the central romance feels unconvincing-it's difficult to believe that such a beautiful, vibrant young woman would find herself drawn to a grotesque and monstrous figure like Nosferatu. This disconnect weakens the emotional stakes of the story.nnWhile Nosferatu deserves praise for its artistry and reverence for the source material, its narrative missteps and odd creative choices hold it back from being a true masterpiece. It's a film that will appeal to fans of classic cinema and gothic horror, but its flaws make it less than the definitive adaptation it could have been.nnA visually brilliant but narratively uneven reimagining of a gothic classic.",A,11/01/2025

rw10253369,tt0105631,Traces of Red (1992),"When you see the phrases neo-noir or erotic thriller, read them as Giallo. Isn't that what it all is, anyway? And who thought that one day, we'd have Jim Belushi as the protagonist of a psychosexual murder movie?nnDirector Andy Wolk would one day make The Christmas Shoes, but for now, he's putting this together from a script by Jim Piddock, who has been in a lot of Christopher Guest's films as an actor but wrote this and two episodes of Silk Stalkings before being the writer of Tooth Fairy.nnBelushi is Jack Dobson, a Palm Beach homicide cop who we initially find flat on his back, dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. His narration takes us back to one evening that shows off just how smooth Jack is, defending a waitress from a rude customer and then immediately taking her back to his place, where he plays some smooth jazz before waking her up to coffee in bed. This movie wants you to know two things: Belushi *****. And Belushi ***** good.nnAlong with his partner, Detective Steve Frayn (Tony Goldwyn), Jack is trying to figure out who is sending him lipstick-sealed threats. Is it meant for his brother Michael (William Russ), who is running for office? And is Jack so on the make that he's willing to potentially sleep with his brother's wife, Susan (Victoria Bass), his partner's wife, Beth (Faye Grant), and definitely get horizontal and Belushi-sweaty with femme fatale Ellen Schofield (Lorraine Bracco)? This movie also wants you to know that every old man in Palm Beach has a filthy mouth, and they all have something to say about how badly they want to schtup Ellen, even if she rode her last husband into a heart attack.nnEllen also sleeps with Steve, even though Steve loves his wife. Everybody is getting with everybody in Palm Beach, which may as well be Rome. Women connected to Jack keep dying, their faces covered with lipstick - yay, Traces of Red! - which his brother reveals is something his first-grade teacher used to do to him before she would rape him. This is a wild departure for the Giallo, not just making its male protagonist vulnerable but seemingly switching him to the villain.nnOr maybe not.nnDespite being shot by his partner - it looked like he was about to choke out Steve's wife - it's soon revealed that the big brother was the one doing all the killing. And hey! There's Belushi, looking like he just smoked one of his weed strains like Oreoz - they're from the streets - or Rewrite. His brother grabs his gun and blows his brains out, ending on a downer note.nnDespite being in theaters for a few days, this did big business on home video. Maybe it's because Belushi wore all his own ties, and people recognized him not just as a fuckable prince of a man but as a sartorial style icon. You know, we should be nicer to him. And by that, I should be nicer to him. For all the horrible things on Twitter, I've learned that he's a pretty chill person - growing all that weed will do that - and the more I think about it, the more good roles in movies by great directors he's been in. He may need a Tarantino casting intervention so that he can complete this late-career reevaluation.nnSo yeah.

Game Changer is one of them. It is a film with a gripping narrative, with great visuals and performances that leave one emotionally drained. It's not just a film; it's an experience, a rollercoaster of emotions and ideas, long after the credits roll.nnA Story That Resonates DeeplynThe plot of Game Changer is a masterstroke of storytelling. It intertwines themes of hope, resilience, and the human spirit in a way that feels both timeless and relevant. The narrative follows a protagonist who, against all odds, embarks on a transformative journey that tests their character and beliefs. What elevates this film is its ability to attain a delicate balance between fantastic, universal themes and very intimate, personal moments. Whether it's the battle against social expectations or emotional battles with oneself, the film connects on an emotionally rich level with the audience.nnThe screenplay is sharp, smart, and layered with nuance. Every scene is crafted to great precision, every line of dialogue purposeful, to fit the entire story together at breakneck pace. It's a thrilling ride, yet somehow room is given for introspection. Each twist and turn is unpredictable yet felt as if deserved, which makes the impact much higher. You end up thinking beyond the film that one needs to about one's life and choices.nnPerformance Elevating the FilmnThe performances of Game Changer are nothing but spectacular. The lead actor did a great job in portraying such a complex multi-dimensional character and is award-worthy. Their performance could deliver a wide array of emotions that are subtle yet authentic, pulling you into the story and making you root for the journey.nnThe supporting cast shines just as much, giving substance and richness to the film. Be it in the antagonist where you can resonate with their goals, or it could be with the mentor whose wisdom guides throughout, every individual is well-developed in this film, making them believeable. Some chemistry between characters brings a massive amount of strength to the drama of the plot, and consequently, to all climactic instances of the movie.nnVisual Technical BrilliancenThe Game Changer is a visually scrumptious film. Every single frame has the beauty of its emotive and aesthetic effect maximally crafted. Using color, light, and a masterful series of camera angles creates a kind of mood that justifies atmosphere for the kind of story meant to be said. Visual symbolisms woven around the film suggest hidden meanings behind each shot.nnEven sound design and the score are marvelous, with beautiful, haunting melodies enriching all these scenes for emotions. In one moment of stunning action scenes or quiet reflections, the world in Game Changer completely holds you up with its immersive soundscape.nnIt is deep because it offers and explores real-life themes in very profound, emotional ways:. It is a movie that delves into questions about identity, purpose, and the courage it takes to defy the status quo. The film challenges viewers to think critically about the world around them and their role within it. It's a story that inspires change-not just in its characters but also in its audience. Few films manage to achieve this level of impact, making Game Changer a rare and invaluable work of art.nnA Truly Universal AppealnThis is one of the magical aspects of Game Changer : it's a movie that appeals to everybody; it's across genres and generations. From thought-provoking dramatics to stunning visuals and gripping narratives, this movie checks all the boxes. It's one of those films that makes people debate and question everything, more so bringing people together. This is a testament to its cultural and artistic significance.nnConclusion: A Must-Watch MasterpiecenGame Changer is more than just a movie. It can be referred to as a powerful narrative. It challenges, inspires, and entertains the individual equally, which makes it a film that everyone must watch. It is a rare commodity in cinema today where one finds a movie mastering all fronts in filmmaking. Game Changer can be said to have done that effortlessly.nnFor those of you looking to watch a movie that will be out of the ordinary, to be frank, this film doesn't do the trick but instead shatters all expectations and exceeds them; Game Changer, simply put, is a movie with 10 stars.",A,11/01/2025

I don't care if they get $2,000 in prize money (after they are eliminated), it would be more fair if Jimmy or the producers just made the teams equally so there is a (somewhat) even amount of boys and girls on a team or just equally physically capable.nnAnd for the games in general, they all feel incredibly luck-based and are just downright unoriginal, the one with the brief cases is somewhat cognitive based, but you really need the endurance and speed to get to the right briefcase in a timely manner. Which can keep the physically challenged individuals away from having a chance of choosing the right one, so for them it is heavily luck-based.nnAs for the third game, flags are placed in a arena and the number of flags will increase each round but so will the amount of players. Now sure there might be some strategy in this (like when to go), but overall it's a speed based game that focuses too much on physical based challeges and is just unfair. Biologically speaking, (hate to be that kind of person), but men are just way more physically capable than women which already puts women at an *unfair* disadvantage.nnThe last ""game"" is some sort of ""trustfall""-esque game where if a member in your group quits to receive a massive cash prize *$5k, $50k and $1M* your whole team is out. I feel like offering 1/5 of the prize money off the bat to one ""lucky"" contestant is unfair while the others only get 2 grand (they recieve this amount of money when they are eliminated. This show just seems incredibly unfair in a lot of ways. And Jimmy constantly saying ""woah guys this is the biggest cash prize in history"" or ""this is life-changing money"" is incredibly annoying.nnAnd his little minions (his dodo-brained friends), randomly out of nowhere just repeat the rules to contestants as if they didn't hear the first or second time Jimmy explained the rules. I feel like they think that the working class (mostly everybody here fighting for the money) are idiots and it's quite rude to underestimate their intelligence. Which leads me into my next point, it's just incredibly sad seeing these working class people fight for a lot of money, while a rich man who has a networth of $1 billion dollars just sits back and watch these people fight for what he makes in just several hours. And in a way this just feels messed up and Jimmy knows this, but the profit he makes from the show is more important to him I guess. I feel that the contestants aren't really having a lot of fun either. Firstly, the games are incredibly bare-bones and unoriginal. This man had $100,000,000 dollars to make a (potentially) very entertaining, fun , and unique show to watch. But it just feels like a very generic and soulless show with not that much substance.nnAlso, lets just talk about controversey for a moment. Jimmy has a lot of insane allegations on his tailgate and doesn't even respond to them appropriately and Amazon (a multi-billion dollar company!!!) decided to give this man ($100M dollars to make a low-quality gameshow that is *potentially* as deceiving and fake as his youtube videos.nnThere is also a breif segment where jimmy is promoting a gambling app to his *CHILD* audience (I don't remember the name of it) gross subliminal messaging isn't cool and you just look like a manipulative scumbag. This just shows the ridiculous amount of greed he has and that he hasn't learned from his past adverts (like him including a slot machine thing where you scan a qr code on the back of a feastables bar and you have the potential to earn a Lamborghini). Who would've guessed, that it was fake *so shocking that a youtuber would lie* (not).nnAnd also the editing on this show is wild (not in a good way) in the game with the flags every time somebody grabs a flag, a stupid ding sound effect would play *EVERY SINGLE TIME* and it was annoying (I guess this was the only part that was annoying that I can remember). And Jimmy and his minions constantly shouting is giving me a headache.nnI don't even want to watch the second episode and you shouldn't either, it's probably going to be just as boring, obnoxious, and repetitive as the first one. The fact that none of the games are cognitive based just leaves the physically uncapable in the dust.nnIn conclusion, Amazon is just embarrassing themselves with this atrocity of a game show. And surprise, surprise, a vast majority of the people left are men. It's insane how this show was awarded 20+ Guinness world records, but nobody cares because Jimmy or his minions aren't as likeable as they used to be. Now they're looked down upon. This show is hot trash it won't get better from here.",A,11/01/2025

I like a good moment when there's tension and reason for a spark between characters but it's mostly scenes where Hank Moody just walks into a room and breathes then a 22 year old needs to drop her panties for him lol. It's an incel's fantasy in that way. I do appreciate that there are strong female characters in it and how it promotes women's sexuality at times, that being said there's too many random occasions that don't add to the plot, but add to the description of a great smut film.

It spawned some sequels which were absolute garbage. That's a sin because this first installment is such a good movie.nnTarantino is a talented writer/director but as an actor he is one of the worst around. His character in this movie is the most irritating people in the movie. You will have more sympathy for the blood-sucking vampires than for the pedophiling, raping, paranoid schizoid Richie that Tarantino plays.

rw10252956,tt4910232,Teen Star Academy (2017),"This movie is basically a nothing burger. Most of the movie is dancing, then they talk for 20 seconds and go back to dancing to this stupid funk music that sounds like it came from garage band. I didn't understand a thing that was happening because they set up 18 plot points and came back to none of them. I can't even say the musics good because these middle school boys are singing about wanting to see girls without clothes.nnNot only is it a nothing burger but it feels like it's aimed towards pedofiles. The title screen makes it look like it's a child trafficking thing, the kids looked drugged, and most of them never show up. The first five or so minutes is just middle school girls in bikinis with random adults dancing around them. At one point this random beach guy has no shirt on and his pants pulled very low, mind you there are kids on this beach, the same guy asked some girls who weren't accepted into the academy to dance for him, so gross imo. Later he sings a love song with middle school girls clapping around him.nnIf you got rid of the weird parts, you get nothing. I was almost in tears by the end because of how horrible it is.

rw10252936,tt7160372,The Zone of Interest (2023),"The horrors of the Holocaust have provided the backdrop to some of the greatest films ever made, but never have the actual atrocities been pushed so far to the boundary of the picture as they are in Jonathan Glazer's profound exploration The Zone of Interest.nnIt is impossible to make a dispassionate Holocaust movie, and this certainly is not that, but the Zone of Interest concerns itself with more unconventional characters than these stories typically focus on. The film follows Rudolph Hoss, the commandant of Auschwitz, and his family as they make their dream home in the shadow of the imposing prison. The film spends almost its entirety within the confines of the home and surrounding grounds, never giving us a visual glimpse inside the neighboring house of horrors. We see lush gardens, and charming home décor, all the while another, entirely different, film is playing for our ears.nnThe sounds of the murder and degradation permeate the film, while juxtaposed with pleasant visual aesthetics. This may be the single most impressive sound design in the history of film. Certainly, one of the most critical to the success and impact of its film. The Hosses are building their Third Reich Dream while one of the darkest chapters of world history is being written a mere feet away. The Zone of Interest accentuates the mundanity of evil. How we can find ourselves so entrenched in the mechanisms of death that we hardly notice it. How malice can seep into our hearts, unnoticed, through our senses.nnGlazer does this without remotely exonerating a single nazi. It is presented matter-of-factly, and without a moment of melodrama, but that serves to make it feel all the more abhorrent. The intentional indifference toward indefensibly heinous acts proved to feel more sickening than deliberate violence fueled by hate. Sandra Huller as the wife, in her second award worthy performance of the year, tries on jewelry and lavish clothing clearly ripped from Jewish prisoners' bodies and laments when they don't fit properly, giving not a notion to what was lost in them being obtained for her.nnThe exhilarating final moments give us the only glimpse we have into any humanity a single member of the family might possess. And even then, it is only presented through the self-serving lens of perceived legacy. For just a moment we see Hoss pause and contemplate his role and how he may find himself viewed in the annals of history. He then regathers himself and continues on his way. Reassured and renewed in his duties, again unmoved by what those duties entail.",A,11/01/2025
rw10252929,tt8999762,The Brutalist (2024),"Pursuing the American Dream is an ambition of almost every immigrant who manages to make it to this country's shores. Its realization can take many forms, too, depending on one's circumstances. But, as many new arrivals discover for themselves, there's no guarantee of success (or, at the very least, they may find that the journey can be more problematic than anticipated). One such story that provides the focus for this optimistic undertaking is the latest offering from writer-director Brady Corbet. The film follows the odyssey of László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a fictional Jewish Hungarian architect who flees Europe in 1947 after being interred in a concentration camp during World War II. He initially struggles to assimilate, to re-establish his career, and to find a way to bring his wife, Erzsebét (Felicity Jones), to America. But, despite these sundry challenges, his fortunes change drastically when he's commissioned to design a high-profile mixed use community center with the generous support of a wealthy and powerful benefactor, a capricious, enigmatic industrialist (Guy Pearce) whose many impulsive, emotionally charged whims provide László with a firsthand introduction to the many possibilities and pitfalls tied to that elusive American Dream. In telling this story, the filmmaker explores the ups and downs associated with these themes, as well as an array of additional diverse story threads involving the protagonist's professional pursuits and personal life. These combined elements make for an engaging and intriguing tale, even if some of the story arcs and character traits are unevenly developed. That sometimes includes the nature of László himself, which is somewhat perplexing given the production's hefty 3:35:00 runtime (with an included intermission), a duration that should provide ample time for the picture to sufficiently flesh out its core narrative elements and character attributes. That shortcoming aside, though, ""The Brutalist"" has myriad strengths to its credit, including the fine performances of Pearce, Jones, Golden Globe Award winner Brody and a host of capable supporting players, along with its superb cinematography, stirring original score, and ably sustained pacing (quite a commendable feat for a film of this length). Admittedly, this offering's solid opening act is far superior to its back half, which tends to sag at times as it wears on, but, on balance, this Golden Globe winner for best drama and best director generally holds up well. In an awards season that has had more than its share of dismal disappointments, it's heartening to finally find a release that comes closer to approaching the standards that a film should embody to merit the kinds of accolades and attention such honorees truly deserve. It may not be perfect, but it's a far sight better than many of its other 2024 cinematic peers.",A,11/01/2025
rw10252919,tt13651794,May December (2023),"Todd Haynes' new film charters uncomfortable territory to be sure. A quasi-tabloid tale of an adult woman having sex with a thirteen year old boy, only to marry and start a family with him once out of jail, is a reasonable nonstarter for some audiences. I believe this is precisely why the film is so important.nnThese type of unfortunate stories too often never get any analysis past the ""ick"" factor, but digging deeper into this uncomfortable subject matter proves worthy. We get uncommon honesty and depth and insight into to the perpetrator, but more importantly we examine the lasting effects of the damage on the victim and also reveal the expansive web of secondhand victims that too often go unnoticed, on the periphery. We can access and better understand the first husband who was humiliated by the event. The children born of the inappropriate relationship as they reach their own adulthood. The friends and acquaintances about town who must cohabitate and reconcile with these people. To sweep this all aside because the material makes one justifiably queasy does a disservice the dozens effected. May December examines these discoveries head on. And that, still, is only half of the story.nnEnter Natalie Portman's character, an actress who is researching the couple in order to play the woman/mom (a fantastic Julianne Moore) character in an upcoming film about the event. This predictably forces certain latent feelings to the surface. Portman proves to be nearly as predatory as Moore as she pursues some evasive truth, unfazed by the destruction she may leave in her wake. It calls to question how much of these type of performance are about true understanding or just sensationalized parroting of real lives that suffered real consequences.nnAs interesting as that all is, it is Charles Melton as the victimized boy, now grown, that gives the most memorable performance. Through him we see the scars left behind by abuse. That those subjected to sexual assault at young ages tend to grow up faster than the rest and simultaneous somewhat not at all.nnTo explain further would be to spoil and also risk making the film seem tedious, which it emphatically is not. Yes, the themes are heavy, but the screenplay itself is very playful and there's a great deal of conviviality throughout. Its sardonic tone makes for an amusing watch, but it is deeply impactful with further examination.

rw10252885,tt0332452,Troy (2004),"As a Greek who has studied the Greek Mythology all his life, I can say that I was disturbed by the inaccuracies of the movie. It was wrong from the start to the end. But I will point out the most important ones, for the ones who want to know: Only Aineias and his father got away of Troy free: All the others were killed, Astyanaktas, the son of Hector was thrown off the walls, and the women were taken. ACHILLEAS DID BEFORE THE FALL OF TROY, AND HE NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH BRISIIDA!!! She was just for... you know for what. Also, Menelaos lived to reach Sparta, with Helen. Paris got killed, and you forgot the legendary: Be afraid of the Greek, even if they bring presents, from Laocoon. After that, Athena (to which the horse was dedicated) sent snakes to kill him and his family. Kassandra, who was cursed by Apollo to know the future but no one to believe her, said that Laocoon was right; no one believed her, and, when Troy fell, Agamemnon took her with him, before being killed by his wife Clitemnistra, and her... yes, Egisthos. Brisiida was never returned to Achilleas, and it was him who gave his armour to Patroclos. He never said that Greeks would not attack for 12 days. Priamos was killed horribly, after witnessing the death of his child (Politis). Then all Gods hated Greeks, and all of them got tortured, had to through all the golden stuff on the sea, etc.. You forgot about how Apollo REALLY killed many Greeks, because Hrisis told him to take revenge from the Greeks who would not give him Hrisiida (Not Brisiida). After giving her, they took Brisiida from Achilleas, and then some others took her, and so on. To conlude, Homer whould not be happy if he were here today, and you should study what was really written, aside from the movies that... lie. Anyway, I loved the graphics.

rw10252849,tt5215088,A.I. Rising (2018),"Low budget, independent films often need to focus on story and character development in very basic setting with minimal special effects. The latter is done quite well (thus 5 points), while ""A. I. Rising"" fails to deliver on the story part.nnFirst, the laughable background. Yes, the plot requires a male and an android female in confined space for a long duration - Why not make him the only engineer with a 3 years contract in an otherwise unmanned space mining operation, with a female android present (for mental health, so he can talk to someone)? Instead his mission is to promote some strange ideologies on a colony, thus he needs to fly over all alone, is given an android to his side, with some weird features expplained in the opening of the movie.nnSecond, what would a grown man do with a very attractive android, which can be remote controlled? Love? Well, damn right! This topic is exploited to an extent, where I thought I was watching soft-core porn instead of Sci-Fi. The film even shows graphs of the android's activity: 95% is, well, you know, the rest some other basic stuff. Half of the time we see the android walking around naked, up to a point, where I ask myself why they bother to get it even dressed in uniform for the few moments - Maybe because the guy wanted to undress something?nnOK, we have a political officer on a space craft with his slave robot... How to advance the story? Malfunction of the robot? Malfunction of the space craft? Sudden regrets of what he's doing? No... he tampers with the android's software (and endangering the whole mission while doing so), so it cannot be longer remotely controlled! With the ""regret-part"" thrown in, it could have been rather interesting. Yet, and off course, his only hope is the love interest would become genuine. Well, tough luck, mate! At least the android shows some logic and considers love not mission critical. Well, only in that case it doesn't make much sense, because it's probably the only thing that kept the poor guy somewhat focused... he becomes depressed, android figures out it/she is the problem and, decides to shut itself down by short-circuiting her battery charging mechanism... see the outcome for yourself!nnA shame, the film could have been so much more in a similar setting. Missed Opportunity. Instead exploring human interaction with opposite gender androids (which can involve love, no problem here), it became some sort of study of a frustrated man. Pity. Missed Opportunity.",A,10/01/2025
rw10252848,tt21192142,All of Us Strangers (2023),"Andrew Haigh proves again with All of Us Strangers that fantasy doesn't always have to be fantastical. All of Us Strangers can be loosely defined as a queer ghost story of sorts, but that does nothing to prepare you for how gripping and affecting the movie is.nnAndrew Scott gives what might be the best performance of the year as Adam, a screenwriter who ventures back to his childhood home searching for inspiration, only to find that his parents who died when he was twelve are there still, preserved as they were the day they died. The film is so uniquely immersive and sublime that the audience never questions this plot device and never seeks greater understanding. I flatly accepted the confines of the story and was enraptured by the scenarios it bred.nnAdam, in his forties or there about, gets to participate in the conversations that were tragically stolen from him by his parents' death. He gets to learn his parents in a way that children don't, and gets to defend his existence to them, even when they may find difficulty in understanding. Claire Foy and Jamie Bell as his parents are equally impeccable in their performances, feeling so authentic and so plausible.nnThe film also serves as a time capsule of the 1980's in that Adam's parents are perpetually stuck in that time, and mired by the values and prevailing sentiments of the era. This is both blessing and curse, but moreso the latter as it specifically pertains to Adam's sexuality. His mom, gripped by the AIDS scare in addition to the general discomfort toward homosexuality common of the time, has difficulty squaring Adam's truth with her own in regards to her son. In my theatre, I sat a couple of seats down the aisle from an older gay couple and one was bravely but unsuccessfully fighting against audibly weeping. I can't imagine the catharsis some older queer people felt watching these scenes, absolutely some of the best of the year.nnThe movie clips by at a comparably lean 105 minute run time, and for all the amazing films that dropped this year, this is the one I wanted more of as the credits rolled. I could have stayed with these characters as they unearthed so much repressed and unrequited emotion for hours. As is, All of Us Strangers is probably the smallest great film of the year, but also one of the most vigorous. There is a bath-like, placid warmth that blankets the entire movie and by the end it just feels generous.

Sharks, CGI monkeys, and a bizarre choice of actor for the lead roll make up the most absurd and laughable parts of this movie, though it's hard to say which is worse. None of these elements fit, and the result is a film that feels more like an unfunny parody than a serious follow-up. A true disappointment that fails to honor the masterpiece it follows.

rw10252833,tt1517268,Barbie (2023/I),"Greta Gerwig's Barbie was not just the highest grossing film and buzziest film of the year, it completely dominated the pop culture landscape of 2023. Barbie was the most significant contributor to the resurgence of film and cineplexes we have enjoyed this year. And while that is certainly noteworthy, it is not why Barbie matters. To reduce the film to its cultural and economic impact is to do disservice to the legitimacy and excellence of the film itself.nnBarbie is singular feat in that it is an IP movie that underwent immense studio and commercial oversight and still came out on the other side as a fierce and poignant work of art. Greta Gerwig and company give us the very best iteration of a Barbie movie we ever could have dreamed of getting. And this fact will become even more into focus over the next decade as every major corporation scrambles to get film treatments for their iconic IP. By the time the inevitable Furby movie hits theatres we will look back at Barbie in same way we look back at the first Iron Man in that it kickstarted and entire arm of the industry. But none will hold a candle to the care and craft exemplified in Barbie.nnThe screenplay is one of the more interesting aspects of the film. It has less subtlety than a catcall, and yet it is still so abundantly clever. There is a voice to the dialogue that I'm not sure I've ever felt before. It is shamelessly expository, but still dripping with irony. Also, while the film sets it sights on certain messages and does nothing to hide those pursuits, it seems to focus its attention on the humor and allows the allegory to take care of itself naturally. It feels like a comedy first and commentary second, yet when you walk away, it is the commentary that sticks.nnAnd it is hilarious. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling shine like pressed plastic in their roles and are deliriously funny throughout. The costumes are undoubtedly the best of the year and production design might be even better. While it can get heavy handed at times, taking patriarchal structures to task and lamenting the excess burden placed upon modern women, these moments are made palatable because these stories have not been told with enough frequency or enough fervor in film history. I would not have guessed it, but not only is Barbie one of 2023 most important films, but one of its best.",A,10/01/2025

Either he shouldn't start as racist as he did, or he shouldn't have changed his heart so quickly in movie time.nnDoc Don Shirley however had a much better arc in the film, only soiled by my knowledge of the real Don Shirley. He is portrayed as someone in between worlds and rather socially awkward, which wouldn't have been the case in real life.nnWith this nitpick out of the way, I have to say that I enjoyed the film thoroughly.

rw10252679,tt33034103,Am I Racist? (2024),"Matt Walsh's deep dive into the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) movement has a lot more truth than many will admit. While the film is billed as satire and a mockumentary, the programs Walsh skewers in this film are real and, at least for a time, tremendously influential.nnIf Walsh's goal is to identify and take down the extremes of DEI movement, his film does a fine job. He takes on some of the most visible (and extreme) proponents of DEI and lays bare the contradictions, self-congratulatory frame, and disconnected elements. In the process, Walsh shows why the US has experienced a significant backlash against these programs as state legislators pass laws to limit their influence.nnThe movie will appeal to more than just conservatives. Many of these programs are simply problematic in the way they are conceived and implemented. ""Am I Racist"" poses fundamental questions about what it means to be racist and what motivates people at the most basic, human level.nnUnfortunately, the movie does not dive deeper into the parts of American culture that led to the emergence of these programs in the first place. DEI initiatives take on many forms, depending on the context and objectives of the organizers. In his attempt to go after the ""bad actors,"" Walsh avoids diving into the complexity of race relations in the U. S. and ways racism can be addressed in more workable and less dogmatic ways.nnStill, the movie is well worth watching, if for no other reason than to understand the current cultural, political, and business backlash against DEI programs.

Today when antisemitism is back at an all time high, films like this are very important (all you need to do is scroll down to the 1 star reviews on this page by people totally unashamed and unafraid to spout their ugly antisemitism, which I notice the people at imdb are happy to keep on their page despite my reporting of them).",A,10/01/2025
rw10252662,tt5574078,Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (2023),"Last night I had a serendipitous event: I viewed the David Lee Fisher version of Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror. I haven't seen this movie, released in 2023 mentioned anywhere and imagined it has been overshadowed by this year's Bill Skarsgård/Nicholas Hoult production and thus had been largely ignored, though Amazon Prime Video and Tubi features it. It's been panned by some but I found it surprisingly well-done. Yes, it begins with some slightly stilted and occasionally bombastic scenery-chewing but settles in when one decides to watch it as if actually set in the period of the story. Then, both cast, dialogue and viewer adjust accordingly. The story blends scenes crafted to copy exactly some from the original 1922 Nosferatu, and occasional dialogue from Lugosi's version. There are some little jewels of cinematic moments, such as the backdrops appearing a combination of painting and projection giving it the primitive cinematic effect of the original. Stylish, artistic, surreal, and gothic, done in black and white. Except for the occasional bright red slash of blood or the golden lick of flames as when the Demeter burns.nnAs a whole, even with the ""high school play"" elements another viewer has panned, I much preferred this one over the 1979 Kinski Nosferatu which simply mirrored the original with dialogue and added nothing new (and believe me, at 82, I've seen a LOT of vampire/Dracula movies to compare it to). I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the latest Nosferatu so I can add it to my very long list.nnSo...we all have our opinions and though my seem to swim against the majority...that's my opinion and I""m sticking to it.",A,10/01/2025

The movie has some predictable moments, but the first half's writing and the 20-minute flashback in the second half are noteworthy. However, some viewers might find the screenplay and editing weak, and the sound mix stale. Despite this, it's a clean family-friendly film.nnRam Charan's performance is impressive, and his character, Appanna, is a highlight. His screen presence is undeniable. The cat-and-mouse chase between Ram Charan and Surya will entertain audiences.nnThe movie showcases the power of an IAS officer and a Chief Electoral Officer, highlighting the challenges of doing good for society. However, few audience may don't feel good about movie.nnWhy? Few individuals may think that i am already aware that I'll be taken advantage of by politicians. I know law & order gonna deceive me, it's no surprise. I'm well aware they will cheat me every term. But you/director/artists do not try to tell me that I could be cheated by them - I can't bear it""nnthat's the reason few may don't feel good about movie because director attempted to cram the entire constitution and its rights into a 2.5-hour film, which may overwhelm audiences, feeling like they're being hit with a dense, heavy book.nnOverall, ""Game Changer"" is a decent watch, but its impact may vary depending on individual perspectives.",A,10/01/2025

So life (well actually I should say Death) puts him in a TRULY no-win situation.nnDid I say ""no-win""? This is the King of no-wins. He can't even solve this particular dilemma by dying.nnDEATH'S GAME starts out as a male-oriented thriller, with non-stop action, and plenty of violence and gore. Keep watching, though, because this series isn't easily categorized. One episode has horror film vibes; another fills in the details of the romance introduced at the beginning. Whatever. I guarantee that you won't complain that it drags-more like a cage-full of squirrels on speed.nnWhat really sets this series apart from others are the excellent special effects, along with some amazing camera work. One shot (pun intended) lets the viewer look at a certain character through a bullet hole that's just penetrated another character's head.nnIf you prefer a narrative with more sophisticated characters and a nuanced view of reality, you might think DEATH'S GAME isn't your cup of tea. The minor characters are mostly sterotypes, especially the villains. But the ML grows and changes-and the focus is mostly on him.nnIf you look at the plot too closely, you'll notice some inconsistencies. For example, it's not clear what happened to the original inhabitant of each of the bodies the ML took over. Some of the rules of the game seem to change over the course of the series. And I personally didn't appreciate the demonization of people who commit suicide. Some, no doubt, are selfish, like the ML. Others are sick. And still others have an intolerable life situation.nnA crow is blown to pieces in one episode. I see anti-crow scenes like this in a lot of dramas these days.

I don't think anyone Finnish was actually involved in writing or fact checking this mess. You know none of the Finnish characters even had Finnish names? At one point they butchered the grammar of something so bad that it sounded pretty lewd to an actual Finnish ear, which at least was hilarious even tho surprising.nnI mean it's a Hallmark movie so what are we expecting but I think the minimum requirement when using another country and culture as a setting is to honor that and not use it as a butchered trope that you probably only asked chatgpt about. If you made a movie that was set in Japan would you hire Russians to pretend to be Japanese while speaking butchered Japanese off paper while your American white girl adventures there?nnIt's a shame because I don't think the acting for the leads was bad and the story was almost cute.

Hong Hee-joo, played by Chae Soo-bin, is brilliant, bringing out the emotional complexity of the character, in addition to the duality of the character, which was portrayed in a spectacular way. Throughout the drama, we see personal growth as he faces several challenges. Internal and external conflicts are portrayed with sensitivity, allowing the audience to connect with his journey. As for Baek Sa-eon, his search for love, affection and understanding were one of the driving forces behind the story. His relationship with Hong Hee-joo is particularly interesting. The chemistry between the two characters is palpable and their interactions are full of emotional tension, as he is willing to fight for what he wants, but he needs to deal with his issues.

The comedy sucks (Sunil and Vennela Kishore characters desperately need the ""DELETE"" button), the intro fight & song combo is horrendous, the romance between Charan and Kiara's characters is so poorly written, and SJ Suryah does eccentric SJ Suryah for the millionth time. Yeah, I should stop looking at this as a Tamil film, because it clearly isn't aiming to be one.nnAlmost every song is a bathroom break, though I like some of the beats in Dhop (along with its vibrant picturization). It was difficult to connect with the protagonist - an IAS officer + IPS officer + Election Officer + Angry Dude in College + whatever the hell the writing needs him to be. We connected with Shankar's protagonists in some of his earlier films because most of them weren't default superheroes. Very often, the circumstance creates one, and that formula worked for him for nearly 2 decades. But gone are those days. I'm not sure what ideas Karthik Subbaraj fed Shankar in the initial stages-ultimately, Shankar chose to give it the same screenplay treatment as Mudhalvan, Sivaji, and the likes.. in 2025. Plus, the only time I bought the performer in Ram Charan was during the short flashback portion, and even that's less impactful.nnKiara Advani is drop-dead gorgeous, though she's mostly relegated to being a song-and-dance prop in the film. Anjali gets a meatier presence than expected, and is fine in the flashback (..not the present). Jayaram is disposable, and Srikanth plays the guy Samuthirakani or Sachin Khedekar usually takes up. My biggest gripe, however, is with the action sequences. I don't remember Shankar directing action this terribly, like EVER. Peter Hein and Anbariv are involved, but to what avail? Every set piece is wholly forgettable. The ""Hari-fication"" of Shankar is well and truly underway, as far as the pacing is concerned. I don't have any faith in his upcoming projects.

The romantic part is well executed and has a nice twist toward the end, but it's sometimes not present enough to stand out amid the chaos.nnThe biggest missed opportunity, however, is the total absence of the bigger picture. In such an epic, where no expense has been spared, I, as a viewer, want a clear understanding of how everything fits together. Instead, the film chooses drama and horror, losing realism and depth in the process. Fortunately, there is Wikipedia.nnStalin refused to cross the Vistula with his troops, leaving the city's citizens to literally fight to the death. The Nazis began executing more than 50,000 citizens as a deterrent, but the uprising continued. District by district was bombed from the air, and the Nazis deployed their worst henchmen who looted and raped as they went. Eventually, the entire city was blown up and set on fire house by house. The Germans planned to turn it into a 'lake.'nnStalin ultimately had little trouble conquering the ruins from the Nazis. Surviving resistance fighters were executed without mercy or sent to the Gulag.",A,10/01/2025
rw10252354,tt14209618,Game Changer (2025/I),"When I said Shankar lost his touch in my Indian 2 review, I also mentioned that he is going to mess up Game Changer as well because he shot both the films simultaneously. And as expected, he did mess up. Badly. Although I must say that this is not as bad as Indian 2, but the bar is so low here that it is easy to pass it. Let's get into the details.nnGame Changer follows the same formula that all Shankar's movies follow. A man trying to set the society along the right path by fighting injustice. We are introduced to Ram (Ram Charan) who is an IAS officer with anger management issues. He was previously an IPS officer with anger management issues. This entire setup is a series of cringe inducing sequences with Ram and Kiara Advani who plays Ram's love interest. The reason Ram becomes an IAS office is equally cringe. Kiara advises Ram to channel his anger to the good of the society and tells him to become an IAS office. But Ram wants to become an IPS officer. She also warns him that she'd not talk with him if he becomes an IPS officer as IPS, somehow, means anger? Anyway, Ram becomes an IPS officer and they breakup. So Ram studies again and becomes an IAS officer. If you are scratching you head at this point, then I must warn you this entire cringe fest takes up all of Act 1 for over 40 minutes without ever introducing us to a conflict. That is how bad Shankar's writing is.nnWhen the conflict does arrive, it is a lame reason that creates a rift between Ram, the IAS, and Mopi Devi, played by SJ Suryah, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh state. What's a Shankar's movie without a flashback? There is an elaborate flashback that takes up all of Act 2 where we are introduced to Appanna (Ram Charan, again. Duh!) and his fight for justice and how he gets betrayed by his own friends. How Ram finds out the truth and defeats Mopi Devi form the rest of Act 3 or what is left of it.nnNow, I don't have a problem with these generic saviour templates. They were fine some 20 years ago. They may have a place even now. However, the way Shankar executed this story with his insipid screenplay and character development is what ruined it for me. Up until Robo in 2010, Shankar made movies that were ahead of their time and in 2025 he is making movies that would have been blockbusters in the 90s. He is the Benjamin Button of filmmakers, except for the worse. He is not updated with kinds of stories that audience expect to watch on the big screen, especially after the pandemic. He is not updated on the latest trends in filmmaking. He is still in his mindset where he spends lavishly on a song to make it rich and colorful.nnAfter watching Indian 2 and Game Changer, I cannot help but think whether Shankar has always been a hack. Did he use the grandeur and lavishness to coverup his lack of skill in filmmaking? Only he knows. But for the rest of us, Game Changer can be skipped completely. Hope you liked this review.nn-YT/@CinephileIndia2023.",A,10/01/2025

However, I think this was partly because I couldn't hear all the words coming out of Dracula's mouth. This made it hard to stay fully focused. I really wish they had added subtitles when he spoke because his heavy accent made it difficult to understand most of the time.nnSecond, the acting was very good overall. I think the girl's performance stood out the most. She was the only character I was truly interested in, and I was happy with her acting. She delivered her role perfectly-her reactions, facial expressions, and body language were all on point. I was completely in love with her performance. Honestly, I don't think they could have found anyone better to play that role.nnFinally, the protagonist-or lack thereof-was an issue for me. I don't think the movie gave anyone the title of a hero or gave us the opportunity to connect with or root for any character. I was hoping to feel something, maybe sadness, for the death of (I won't spoil), but I didn't. I didn't feel any empathy for the characters. To be honest, if all the characters in the movie had died, I wouldn't have cared or felt anything for them.nnThat said, the visuals, camerawork, and graphics were top-tier. I absolutely loved how they created the atmosphere in such a scary and immersive way. However, the nudity and sex scene felt completely unnecessary. Why would the guy agree to sleep with a girl he knew was possessed by Something?

While cyber fraud was something that took my attention, action scenes were more noisy and melodramatic than adrenaline filled.nnLet me put some cringe filled situations related to action sequences:nn1. The theatre scene was exact copy of movie The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington when he goes to a pub run by Russians to save Chloe Grace. If you haven't watched that movie, go watch it and its action scenes.nn2. The action artists whom Fateh ram every now and then felt useless and unrealistic. Like he kills 100s of them in one scene, but none comes forward in a group to kill him.nn3. Fateh could fly a knife and kill his opponent, but all the opponents were dumb and dumber and never do the same on him.nn4. When Fateh doesn't have guns, opponents also doesn't. In one scene the opponent had, and Fateh was able to steal it from him without much effort. Really.nnPeople who are comparing its action sequences with John Wick are forgetting that in John Wick, it's his suit that soaks all the gun shots. And as and when John fights forward, he gets equally exhausted and shows pain. In Fateh, Sonu Sood plays God mode and nothing less.nnNow I am not against this movie or Sonu Sood, and i really appreciated his direction.

rw10252258,tt14961016,Ainda Estou Aqui (2024),"I'm Still Here (2024), directed by Walter Salles, is a powerful and deeply emotional exploration of survival, loss, and reinvention during a period of intense political repression in Brazil. Set in 1971, during the tightening grip of a military dictatorship, the film follows a mother who is forced to navigate a shattered life after her family becomes a victim of arbitrary violence. As she faces unimaginable challenges, she must find the strength to reinvent herself in a world where every step she takes is fraught with danger.nnFernanda Torres gives a standout performance as the mother, capturing the emotional depth and inner turmoil of a woman who must protect her family and reclaim her life amidst brutal circumstances. Torres' portrayal is both heart-wrenching and empowering, as her character transitions from victim to survivor, embodying the strength and resilience that is often necessary when facing oppression. Alongside her, Fernanda Montenegro and Selton Mello provide strong supporting performances, adding emotional layers to the film's rich narrative.nnSalles' direction is intimate and evocative, drawing the audience into the emotional and political landscape of the time. The cinematography is stunning, with vivid contrasts between the starkness of the political environment and the personal, quiet moments of the protagonist's struggle. The pacing allows the film to breathe, taking the time to explore the complexities of its characters while maintaining the tension of a society on the brink of collapse.nnThe narrative is both personal and political, offering a window into the life of an ordinary woman thrust into extraordinary circumstances. The historical context of the Brazilian dictatorship is woven seamlessly into the personal story, emphasizing the widespread fear and the loss of agency experienced by many under authoritarian rule. While the film's pace may seem slow to some, it allows for a deeper emotional connection to the characters and their experiences.nnI'm Still Here is a film about resilience in the face of tyranny, about finding hope amidst despair, and about the courage to rebuild when everything has been taken away. It is a haunting reminder of the human cost of political repression, and an inspiring portrait of one woman's journey to reclaim her identity.nnRating: 8/10. A gripping, emotional journey that combines a personal story with the broader struggles of a nation under dictatorship, featuring a stellar performance from Fernanda Torres.",A,10/01/2025

Not to mention the profanities and all the foul language between a mother and a daughter, all the sexual connotations. Can anyone produce a show without profanities and overly sexual dialogs? Thornton is pretty good in portraying a weak male character (towards his women), who constantly gets humiliated by his slutty hysteric gold digger X with a spoiled brat of a daughter to match. His over tolerant attitude is annoying enough but who in a right mind would allow his teen daughter to walk half-naked all over the house all the time?! That's supposed to be funny, I guess.

rw10252205,tt27679608,Fateh (2025),"The way Bollywood Movie Fateh narrates things, it doesn't show a good beginning for the Hindi Movie lovers in 2025. This is true that much was at stake on this Movie; the so-called first charismatic cinematic presentation in 2025. But it has failed to impact and there are several factors behind this.nnThis is true that crime has emerged as the most dominating theme in the Celluloid world during the last few years. The Movie Fateh also narrates a crime story. It narrates the story of Cyber crime and related affairs. This issue is burning one in today's context. This proves that the Movie had ample opportunity to make experiment. Nevertheless, this Movie doesn't look Impressive. The main reason behind this is the Movie fails to prove purpose and relevance. The action keeps fluctuating too frequently which distracts attention. The Movie seems to cover the whole world of Cyber Crime and the reality is obvious. There are some melodramatic sequences which make the Movie more monotonous.nnPoor characterization is another weak point of the Movie. It is really hard to find relevance of some of the characters in the Movie. Similarly, acting is not up to the mark in this Movie. Sonu Sood seems lacking acting depth despite his reputation. Even actor like Nasiruddin Shah also seems stereotypical. What can be more unfortunate?nnThe remaining damage has been done by the Playback Singers. The composition and song sequences are of poor quality.

rw10252185,tt27040794,Replicator (2024),"Where do I begin with a film like this? Let's start with the Pros:n- There is solid cinematography on display here, far better quality than this film deserves.nn- That's about it.nnNow for the Cons:n- First off, this film has some of the worst writing I've seen this side of a Neil Breen film. Characters say what they're thinking with almost no subtext whatsoever. Weird attempts at humor pop up out of nowhere and make the scenes feel like a series of loosely connected SNL skits. Subplots are brought up and then either dropped immediately, or ham-fistedly woven back into the script at the last second. It honestly seemed as though the writer/director had a handful of different films he wanted to make and rather than choose the best out of the bunch, he just decided to throw them all together into one stupid gumbo of a movie.nn- Secondly, the acting is mostly community theater level bad. KateLynn Newberry gives probably the best performance of the lot, but the bar is so low here, that's not saying much. The lead and the sheriff are both quite wooden and their subplot mostly amounts to nothing.nn- The creature effects are pretty forgettable. You can really tell there was a limited budget here. Everyone else seems to rave about the practical effects, but there was really nothing special about them. And aside from a limb getting amputated in the first five minutes, there's very little in the way of bloodshed, considering this is supposed to be a horror/thriller film.nn- Jumping back to the Neil Breen comparison, this film -- like Breen's -- has a lot it wants to say about justice and morality, but it doesn't know how or when to say it. In fact, like many bad movie before it, 'Replicator' seems to preach the same tired sermon of ""bad people are bad"" and ""elected officials are corrupt, but they really shouldn't be."" It's cheap, uninspired, childish writing and there's really no excuse for it.nnBottom line: This is a terrible, awkwardly paced and utterly forgettable film with high school level writing, zero heart, bad acting, awkward staging, budget effects, and a central idea that just doesn't work. With the exception of some good looking cinematography, this film flounders in every possible way.nnWhile some films are so bad, they're good, this film is so bad that it's just bad.nnSave your money and watch a Breen film instead.

That's what this season felt like: a parade of irritating characters, laughably predictable plotlines, and moments so cringeworthy I nearly sprained something from second-hand embarrassment.nnLet's dissect the sisters, shall we? Eva. Oh, Eva. Nothing says ""grief"" like sleeping with your dead sister's husband and then declaring your have feelings for him. Because who needs time to process a tragedy when you can just leap straight into bed and call it character development? Becka, meanwhile, is the human embodiment of a toddler smashing plates and then whining when nobody congratulates her for it. Treating a nice guy like garbage? Check. Facing zero consequences? Also check.nnUrsula? Oh, sweet, forgettable Ursula. Her pill-popping storyline was so irrelevant I genuinely forgot it was a thing until I started writing this.nnAnd then there's Bibi, who I wanted to like-but even her sharp wit couldn't save her from being dragged down by the sheer misery of this season. And don't even get me started on her wife, who decided the best time to pick an IVF fight was when Bibi's sister had literally just died. Timing, babe. Read the room.nnBut the real MVP of Season 2 was Grace's early exit. Her departure was the one moment of pure, unfiltered joy I felt all season. If she'd stuck around, I wouldn't be writing this review because I'd have launched my TV out the window.nnThe writing, though... oh, the writing. It felt like a poorly planned school project.

Honestly, she deserves her own segment in this review because her entire purpose seemed to be dragging the show further into the abyss. Annoying, unnecessary, and about as welcome as a fly in your wine.nnThen there's the plot-or lack thereof. Once Grace was gone (thankfully), the story spiralled into a predictable sludge of clichés and eye-roll-inducing twists. Every time the writers thought they were being clever with foreshadowing, it landed with the subtlety of a marching band crashing through a library. The whole thing felt like it was desperately trying to be clever and edgy, but it ended up about as fresh as yesterday's fish.nnThe only saving grace-pun intended-was the opening titles.

Five out of ten of the highest grossing films in 2024 were animated films.nnSo, it is a bummer that an animated take of one of the most successful film franchises of all time would not fare well.nnBefore anything else - Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirim is not a bad film. But it has many problems. Even in conception, it is reportedly a fast-tracked project in order for New Line Cinema to maintain the film adaptation rights for J. R. R. Tolkien's novels.nnNevertheless, it still looks beautiful, as it is animated by a competent Japanese Studio and a seasoned anime director, Kenji Kamiyama. It's traditional, hand-drawn style juxtaposed with painted backgrounds remind one of Hayao Miyazaki or Makoto Shinkai films. It looks, however, inferior to both.nnContrary to the epic, high fantasy setting of Middle Earth films, The War of the Rohirim is about rival human factions in Rohan almost 200 years before the Fellowship of the Ring. It focuses on princess Hera, as she races against time to defend her people against the vengeful Wulf.nnThe film also highlights Helm Hammerhand, King of Rohan and Hera's father. Wulf's path to vengeance ignited when King Helm accidentally killed Wulf's father, Freca, in a brawl, with a single punch. Freca initially offered Wulf to marry Hera. Helm declined due to the suspicion that Freca only wanted the throne. Insulted, Freca challenged Helm to a duel leading to his demise.nnYears passed and Wulf successfully gathered an army of outlanders, determined to destroy the Hammerhand family and take the throne of Rohan by force.nnAgain, not at all a bad premise. The overall story is actually compelling and paced well.nnThe downside is how it failed to capture the appeal of The Lord of The Rings, especially for an animated project that could easily replicate and showcase its fantastical elements. On the other hand, there is no problem in choosing a human-filled faction and story.nnRemember that the events centered around Rohan from the classic films contained some of the most epic and memorable battles in the history of cinema.nnThe difficulty of reproducing these sequences, may it be due to the limitations of the medium, or the narrative constraints, likely contributed to why it drew less audiences from both the LOTR fandom and anime fans alike.

In Los Frikis, Fidel Castro does not loom large, he's the boogeyman of this anti-Communist propaganda. Most propaganda can be dismissed with the adage; ""there are two sides to every story and then there's the truth."" Yet Los Frikis has an axe to grind and does not let up.nnThe main character's older brother is a Friki, a Punk Rocker who is anarchist aesthetically yet conservative politically. We learn that Rock music is banned in Cuba yet there is no mention of Radio Free America and other decades old U. S. State Department programs using Jazz musicians and later rappers to present the U. S. as a free and progressive society without a race problem.nnThe cast of Los Frikis is beautiful, stylish and tanned. They are also largely Cuban. The writers and directors are not and curiously, they don't have Wikipedia pages yet they have the budget and backing to pull off Los Frikis.nnReturning to the cast, there is a caste of course and an island with a huge Black population is not rendered here. Race in Cuba does not function as it does in the U. S., I'm well aware of that, however the Black characters of Los Frikis are there but never really present.nnThe two characters that die in the film are Black. There's an unnamed Black woman whose body washes ashore, from god only knows where. Aren't we in the midst of questioning violence visited upon Black bodies on film? And there's the infantilized Black character, burdened by mobility issues, a virus and dare I say his color. There is another Black character who doesn't die that appears in two scenes. One scene where this massive Black man is introduced as HIV positive. Here he utters his one line, one with a homophobic slur because, lest you forget, Cubans are machistas and Black people are homophobic and he's muscular. The second scene, he's silent, he's only there to share his body. This movie isn't one for subtletynnThroughout the film we have another infantilized character, Gustavo, however his being preyed on by a much older divorcee is presented in a fetishizing manner. One where hot Cubans fall in love. This storyline seems so out-of-place in the second decade of the 21st century because there are power dynamics and age that call consent into question. Especially since Gustavo is introduced as someone living in peril, thanks to Fidel.nnAnother curious scene is where two characters learn of a medical advance to treat AIDS while watching an American television program with nifty subtitles in Spanish. The U. S. infamously sacrificed its own with right-wing policies towards AIDS and HIV.

When Karen became pregnant, and that guy abandoned her, she started acting innocent around Gary. Gary stepped in to help her, and I thought, Finally, things are working out. But oh my God, they weren't! At her birthday party, she went back to seducing the guy who had left her.nnI mean, I am utterly disappointed. Usually, people rate movies poorly when they're dissatisfied, but I won't. Why? Because even though this movie leaves me dissatisfied, it delivers a brutal truth that was depicted 40 years ago.

My mind keeps screaming that being a nice guy feels like living in hell. Yet, that's what makes someone a ""nice guy."" Do I have to become selfish or a ""whore"" to escape this? No. Neither would I want to be naive like Gary. And yes, I called Gary dumb, but deep down, I don't believe he truly is. It's just the situation he's in. Still, I couldn't stomach the last scene where Karen pitied Gary. What a betrayal! It's better to be alone than to be with someone you value and worship, only to realize they don't value you in return.",A,10/01/2025
rw10252069,tt1675434,Intouchables (2011),"For those of you who don't know, Omar Sy is one half of a famous Canal + sketch comedy show called Omar & Fred. To sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & François Cluzet were best friends in real life. François Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was ""Ne Le Dis à Personne"" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.",A,10/01/2025

rw10251846,tt0043274,Alice in Wonderland (1951),"I will admit that I'm not a die hard Wonderland fan, so I can't say for sure whether this is a faithful adaptation, but if there's one thing that I know about the original work, it's that it does not have much of a plot, and the whole point of it was to charm people with its nonsensical nature and fabulous characters. Unfortunately, this is something that some people tend to overlook when reviewing this movie.nnWhat's the story?nnA girl named Alice has a dream where she chases a talking white rabbit.nnIf that summary seemed really brief, it's because, just like the book, the plot isn't the main focus. Its characters are the key to what makes the movie good. I'll start with Alice. She is a very unique and entertaining character. While the contrast between her childlike curiosity and her sophisticated Victorian accent/vocabulary (shoutout to Kathryn Beaumont) may seem jarring on paper, the two elements surprisingly blend together well and make her quite endearing. Also, to people like me who prefer orderliness but live in a chaotic world, she's very relatable. The way she goes from being nonchalant about the madness around her to becoming increasingly annoyed by it makes the story more compelling as well. The villain, the Queen of Hearts (who is the maddest resident of Wonderland in more ways than one), is very entertaining, but is also appropriately threatening. The other characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Dodo, and the Caterpillar (who shocked me during my first viewing because I couldn't believe that his hookah smoking was allowed in a Disney movie) are all very fun characters who provide great moments of comedy.nnThe animation of this film is fantastic. The backgrounds are very vibrant and pleasant to look at. Also, when it comes to the characters, the animators seized the opportunity to let loose and take full advantage of the cartoon medium. This makes for some very unique and memorable moments, from the sequences of Alice growing and shrinking to the Cheshire Cat's special powers (standout moments include when he literally stands on his own head and when he turns invisible, leaving only his smile behind) to the energetic and hilarious tea party sequence. These kinds of moments help give the film its own distinctive identity amid the other Disney movies.nnThis film holds the record for having the most songs out of any Disney movie (even if some of those songs are only 10 seconds long), and they're all pretty good, with my personal favorite being, ""All in a Golden Afternoon.""nnAs a movie, I think Alice in Wonderland is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, people tend to judge it unfairly for its lack of a plot. If you're going to judge this film, you have to remember that the original books didn't have much in the way of plot. After all, the plot isn't what matters when it comes to this particular story. It's the characters and the environment they inhabit that really matter, and, in this case, Disney did a great job of making both of those memorable.",A,10/01/2025

This one is definitely a pretty good time waster, an actionner providing fun, body count, and everything you wish with this kind of stuff. Dave Bautista was made for this role, and I am surprised that he did not play more characters like this one. By the way, the villain whose physique matches Dave Bautista's the most, the giant whom I don't know the name, I have read that he was also cast for 2015 SPECTRE for which Bautista eventually ended up getting the role. Now, maybe this is the revenge for the other big man? Don't miss this actionner, especially if you craved for SUDDEN DEATH, back in 1995. It was starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.",A,10/01/2025

Fred Astaire (Top Hat, Holiday Inn) is our Narrator, S. D. Kluger. Mickey Rooney (Captain Courageous, National Velvet) brings Kris Kringle aka Santa Claus to life. Keenan Wynn (Annie Get Your Gun, Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb) speaks for Winter Warlock. Paul Frees of several Disney and animation features, must have had a blast as the grouchy Mayor Burgermeister Meisterburger / Grimsley. Robie Lester voices Miss Jessica / Mrs. Claus.

He often teamed up with directora Jules Bass & Arthur Rankin Jr on the classic holiday projects. They specialized in claymation and live-model stop action. Their work is adorable & whimsical. Every single one is a timeless classic. 🎅ICTT is more of the same.nn🦌 Abandoned at birth, Kris Kringle was taken in by the toy-making elves. His was a childhood filled with cheer, love and meaning. At the same time, the nearest town was gradually descending into a cheerless and harsh place under the authoritarian rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger. He's a typical creep with too much power. He stumbles on a toy one day and decides to outlaw toys! So when Kris comes to town bearing gifts, he's labeled outlaw #1.nn🎁 Does that scare Kris away? Does the fact that the kids' beautiful teacher, Miss Jessica, seems to hate him scare him? Not at all. Kris is on a mission to preserve the magic of childhood. He will continue with his course of comfort, cheer, generosity, and love. When I was a kid, the idea of people hating Christmas was the most fantastical thing about this tale. The theme that we must fight back against the encroaching darkness with love and generosity has never been more cogent. Kris also demands that the kids behave well to be rewarded. Rewarding goodness and correcting naughtiness is part of the fight.nn⛄ Put one foot in front of the other is a wonderful song that stuck with me over the years.

The film explores Bonhoeffer's moral struggles, his faith, and his ultimate decision to join a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. With a strong performance by the lead actor and compelling storytelling, the movie highlights themes of courage, sacrifice, and the cost of conviction.

Due to his inability to accept himself or anything nice into his life he pretends he's straight like he has been for 47 years, and ultimately destroys the only thing that has made him feel alive. Sad.nnI swear to God nothing occurs in this movie for an hour and a half; there's a lot of macho posturing and Nick being divorced. I cannot stress enough how much time they spend not really even preparing, just kinda hanging out in Nice.

rw10251269,tt17526714,The Substance (2024),"First, I'll start with the PROS:nnThe camera work is well done, though it sometimes feels cliché for the horror genre (how many close-up needle injections and slow-zoomed agonized stares into mirrors do we really need? We get the point!). Sorry, these are supposed to be the pros.nnThe acting is mostly good, especially from Demi Moore (Elisabeth) and Margaret Qualley (Sue). I'll get to Dennis Quaid's character, Harvey, soon. The sound design and its use as a motif are intriguing-the chewing, the soda gulps, the intense soundtrack, etc. It was well-shot, with unique set designs and solid editing. Now, onto...nnThe CONS:nnThe first half an hour or so is okay. Strangely, it is rushed in some places and over-reinforced in others. We're constantly shown how upset Elisabeth is about being an aging star and has a d*** for a boss, yet we know nothing about this company producing this 'substance.'nnAs soon as she gets the black-market drug, things go downhill.nnWho are these people making this new drug? Why doesn't she do a quick internet search and at least get a few reviews before injecting herself with green goo? She doesn't even pay for it. Okay, fine, I'll let that slide- for now.nnThen, Elisabeth splits in two. Is she sharing complete consciousness with a younger version of herself, or is this just an echo of who she was? Does she look like a younger version of herself? If so, then people would recognize her, right? If they have to switch every seven days, with no exceptions, what is the end game? This is why a little setup goes a long way. But writer/director Coralie Fargeat wants to skip all that and get right to the gore as soon as possible!nnThe story's second act is rather basic, and the central theme is tired and overdone: A feminist take on how men are at fault for holding women up to unrealistic beauty standards as they age. Harvey telegraphs this theme to Elisabeth while chomping on shrimp at the restaurant.nnElisabeth's character is not very developed either. We know that losing her looks is eating Elisabeth up inside (some pun intended), but all the character's issues seem to be placed square on the shoulders of everyone except her. It's almost as though she had to take this drug, or her life and career were over. This makes her selfish at best. And I tend not to care what happens to selfish characters.nnDo we really need that much aerobics butt shots of Sue? Do we need that many butt shots in general? We get the point. And why are aerobics shows so popular in this world? Did I miss something? What years is this, 1985?nnEvery man in this story is evil, stupid, or both. Harvey is so over-the-top that I stifled laughter whenever he appeared on screen. Who did this guy's wardrobe?! His character alone took me out of the world of serious drama and into the land of cheesy horror. The old man who signed Elisabeth up for the substance didn't seem to have good intentions. Even Troy, the casting directors, and Harvey's minion execs are mean (but Harvey did a great job training them to sit on cue!).nnElisabeth's old acquaintance she runs into seems to be a nice guy. This could have been a great subplot, but Fargeat makes this man a dull doofus rather than a real shot at Elisabeth finding happiness with a man as imperfect as she is.nnThen there's the ending-one of the dumbest things I have ever witnessed. Fargeat clearly went for the cheap shock factor, tossing out whatever credibility the story had left instead of a poignant message at the end. The final images were unique, but are we supposed to believe that a human head with no body (substance or substance) can crawl and gaze up at the trees while reminiscing? HORRIBLE!nnI know art is subjective, but I can't see how anyone could think this gross, unnecessary film was anything but laughable.nnI gave the film one extra star because of its technical aspects.",A,10/01/2025

rw10251238,tt0061184,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966),"Never mind Virginia Woolf, she's a lightweight compared to ""Martha"" (Elizabeth Taylor) as ""Nick"" (George Segal) and his wife ""Honey"" (Sandy Dennis) are about to discover for themselves. They've already been at a faculty do with her and husband ""George"" (Richard Burton) and have gone round after for a nightcap. That's their first mistake as a vitriolic battle of sarcastic and venomous wits is just getting started between their hosts. Initially they are sympathetically embarrassed but then that morphs into something a little more participative as the brandy and the bourbon starts to take effect on everyone. In vino vertitas has never been more true as it emerges that the older couple have a son, the other bugger, and it's clear from early on that something on that front is not right. The younger couple are not immune from the prevailing toxicity and before long they are also starting to question some of what underpins their own relationship. As tempers flare, things become even more unpleasant - even violent, as there are no holds barred and psychological cruelty becomes the benchmark for just about all of them. I saw this on stage and loved it. On the big screen, Mike Nicholls has used his cinematic advantages to make it even more potent. By using the cast together, splitting them off into pairs, changing the location from their increasingly small living room, occasionally involving an innocent bystander to temporarily lessen the stress levels and even pouring some coffee into them, we tell a remarkably hard-hitting story of grief. A festering, poisonous emotion that when not dealt with can grow to throttle just about any relationship - especially if the vintner is on it, too. Taylor and Burton excel, there's no other word for it. Her performance makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up and is perfectly foiled by the more understated but just as brutal characterisation of ""George"" by a Burton rather benignly bedecked in his middle-aged cardigan - but don't be fooled. Though the plot doesn't focus so much on the others at the start, both Segal and a strong effort from Dennis come into their own too as the ghastliness of their new friends proves contagious and noxious. It's also directed as if we were watching from various points in the room, which adds extra impact as we see things from differing perspectives - but always with a horribly natural flow. It often comes across as a continuous stream of filming akin to how it would be presented live on a stage. This is cinema at it's most visceral with compelling characterisations and dialogue that really does hurt. Maybe don't watch if you've just had a row, or a few drinks, or both?

rw10251217,tt0109830,Forrest Gump (1994),"Someone like Forrest Gump to exist in the wide world is impossible, but there are 7 billion people in the world and I prefer seeing the half full glass rather than the half empty one. But the problem is if you are like Forrest Gump you are considered unintelligent as being real in this world is being foolish. In the movie he is someone with an IQ of 75, and he is denied admission in a normal school as the minimum required IQ to join is 80, but his mother makes sure that he goes to normal school.nnEckhart Tolle talks about living in the 'now' in his book ""The Power of Now"" and Gump is a perfect example of someone who lives in the 'now' and I think the director or screenplay writer might have used the feather to symbolize it, ""like swaying wherever the wind takes it"". Forrest Gump's life too sways along with the wind in a positive way, though everyone in the world won't be that lucky. Thanks to the three bullies he gets rid of his crutches, gets a place in the college, football team, joins the army, becomes a national celebrity and also gets to meet different presidents and also ends up doing things nobody does especially when meeting someone like the president (He ends up showing his butts to the president). Gump meets Bubba in the Army and Bubba always keeps blabbering about shrimp. It's that blabbering what defines Gump and his captain's life after they leave army. The captain initially blames Gump for saving his life, as his legs gets amputated in the battle.nnThe most impressive ability of Gump is his ability to love unconditionally, now that's a trait not impossible to find but very rare to find, I am talking about real unconditional love not ""you do this i love you, you don't do this i hate you"" kinds of love. There is a scene where the girl he loves aka Jane goes naked and make Gump hold her bosoms and he ends up ejaculating within moments, now that shows his passion for Jane. And then there is another scene where she is on a stage naked with a guitar singing and there are men surrounding her expecting her to do some kinky stuff and then there is Gump who feels happy for her watching her sing on the diaz because he remembered her saying to him once that was her dream, ""To sing on a stage while everyone were cheering for her."" He didn't knew the world enough to understand that it was a different kind of stage and different kind of cheering. Jane doesn't reciprocate his feelings, she does have a soft corner for him but is not ready to make him her boyfriend, maybe because of the abuse she had to face from her father in her childhood, maybe she is thinking she might corrupt his innocence, maybe he might hate her if he knew what kind of a life she lives, maybe she friendzoned him, maybe because he is stupid or maybe there could be several reasons which can be understood only if another movie or book is made or written through her POV. Though in the end when she is dying she wants her to marry him and accept her child which she claims to be his, and Gump marries her and accepts the kid without any second thoughts. Gump never judged her, Gump always loved her no matter what.nnFor being real, loving unconditionally, not hating the world, for always minding his own business the intelligent ones keeps asking him, ""Are you stupid ?"" and yet he has very little qualms and answers, ""Stupid is as stupid does""",A,10/01/2025

The New Indian Express describes it as ""an irresistible guilty pleasure,"" noting that while it introduces intriguing subplots, it ""errs a little too much on the side of caution,"" leading to a narrative that doesn't fully commit to its potential.nnOn Rotten Tomatoes, audience reactions highlight the film's adherence to ""the usual clichés and an inconsistent plot,"" with some viewers appreciating the continuation of the romance, while others criticize its predictability and lack of depth.nnDecider's review points out that the lead actors ""find themselves saddled with insipid dialogue and working through nonsense plotting,"" suggesting that the film struggles to deliver a compelling narrative despite the cast's efforts.nnIn summary, ""Culpa Tuya"" offers a continuation of the passionate and forbidden romance that began in ""Culpa Mía.""

I mean, I would even feel more comfortable with a nameless villian since Rasputin was never hostile to the Romanov, it feels super off having him as the villian, fortunetly, I really forget about that while the movie flowed, that is of course an achivement of the movie, making you so invested, that you forget you're watching a fanfic that couldn't even get the years right.nnOverall good, if you like the work of Bluth, Disney, musicals, or even cinema in general, don't miss this one.",A,10/01/2025

rw10250743,tt28453165,"""Yeorahob Sunjeong"" (2006)","Impressively, it was a meaty 167 episodes daily drama that left me with conflicting feelings. To get some positives out of the way, I much appreciate the roughness and scuffiness of older dailies over the jaded cleanliness and overly-sanitized modern dailies. It's a good thing that conflicts don't last a long time in this lengthy drama, but this also created a problem I'll talk about later. The drama took advantage of its length in regards to the main point of tension with the objecting parents of the ML, simply, let the girl hang around long enough until they get used to her. Now, let's get into the underlying problems. There was a love triangle involving the 70ish elderly father, his 50ish son, and the restaurant lady, I've never seen such an absurd, trashy and distasteful love triangle like this one before. It's shocking how much screen time they dedicated to that which was for almost the entire runtime. Due to its length, the drama was somewhat divided into 2 halves that were different enough to consider one a downgrade over the other. The exact point that split it into 2 halves was when the pseudo love triangle/square over the FL was resolved. In comparison, the most glaring difference was with the characters' writing of the duo Uk Yeong & Yun Jeong, they made them dumb, quirky, and borderline retarded, just because they were out of the circling conflicts from the first half and had no other roles to justify their existence in the drama. It's clear that its length was problematic. There was a shocking lack of material to fill the runtime. Initially, it had many small side plots that seemed promising but were completely dropped off after a handful of episodes, for example, the rouge sister Yun Ji and her ostracized family. There was only 2 main plotlines running in parallel, whatever was the FL involved in and the repulsive elderly love triangle. This could've been easily fixed since they already had enough pieces laid out. For example, give Shin Hyeong a full family background dynamic to interact with everyone rather than being a random employee with no attachments to anything, replace the elderly love triangle with another involving Wu Suk and other characters, despite the established premise but giving the female lead some familial connections would strengthen her character's existence, and lastly give the lead couples more problems to overcome rather than a couple of elongated ones. Finally, there was a huge lack of affection from the female lead while the male lead was always loud, clear and persistent about his love, she couldn't reciprocate his feeling with the same level if any at all, leaving a constant weird imbalance in their relationship. As if she was pressured to accept his love and run with it, nonetheless, this was less of a problem later on. At the end of the day and despite everything, this was just an okay vanilla daily drama.",A,10/01/2025

rw10250650,tt33208023,"""Secret Level"" (2024) {Warhammer 40,000: And They Shall Know No Fear (#1.5)}","Overall, I really enjoyed 'And They Shall Know No Fear'. The visuals were absolutely stunning. The high production value was immediately apparent, with each scene feeling meticulously crafted, from the sweeping battle vistas to the intense close-quarter combat. The environments were rich in detail, and the choreography of the action sequences had a level of polish that made the entire experience feel cinematic. It's clear that a lot of care went into making the episode look incredible, and for the most part, that paid off in spades.nnHowever, one thing that struck me was just how similar this episode is to Astartes, the fan-made YouTube shorts that gained a massive following in 2018-2019. Given that Syama Pedersen, the creator behind Astartes, is credited with this project, it's not surprising that many of the visual and stylistic elements feel lifted directly from his earlier work. The way the Space Marines move, the camera angles, and the focus on raw action all felt reminiscent of Astartes' intense, nearly silent, high-octane action. That's not necessarily a bad thing - Astartes was a fan favourite for a reason-but it does feel like this episode owes a lot to that series, almost to the point of feeling like a re-skinning.nnThat brings me to my slight disappointment with the episode. While I thoroughly enjoyed the action and found the visuals impressive, it did feel a bit like a rehash of Astartes combined with elements of other Space Marine lore. There are so many great storylines and possibilities in the Warhammer 40K universe, yet this episode played it safe by focusing heavily on familiar action beats and themes that we've already seen. It almost felt like a re-make or a polished version of the Astartes shorts, without offering much in terms of new direction or complexity. That left me wanting more-something deeper or more original that could set this apart as its own entity rather than just a continuation of a fan-made series, albeit with a bigger budget.nnThe rest of the episode introduces some interesting concepts, like a Chaos creature tied to the god Tzeentch, who uses the Warp to manipulate the situation and bypass the usual combat. While it added a layer of intrigue, I couldn't help but feel that the main draw of the episode was still the action-Space Marines in all their glory. And while they are undeniably cool, that also brings me to the next issue I had with the episode.nnThe Space Marine focus, while visually appealing, feels a bit shallow when considering the broader lore of the 40K universe. Space Marines are not just genetically enhanced warriors-they are the product of a brutal, often tragic process that turns children into soldiers who will likely never return to their families. The episode could have delved into this more grim aspect, but instead, it continues to present the Space Marines as the heroic, cool warriors we're used to seeing. This disconnect between the idealized version of Space Marines and their dark, harsh reality is one of the core themes of Warhammer 40K, and it's a bit disappointing that it wasn't explored further.nnAdditionally, there are so many other factions within the 40K universe that deserve more attention. While Space Marines get all the glory, groups like the Aeldari, T'au, and even the Imperial Guard are often relegated to the sidelines. These factions are rich with their own stories, struggles, and philosophies, yet they rarely get the spotlight compared to the ever-popular Space Marines. This episode was another example of that imbalance, with the focus largely staying on the Space Marine angle, to the detriment of the larger universe.nnAnd They Shall Know No Fear is undoubtedly a visually stunning and action-packed ride, but it sometimes feels like it's leaning too heavily on established ideas from previous works, particularly Astartes. While the 'bolter porn' and epic visuals are certainly fun, the episode could have pushed the boundaries more, exploring the deeper lore and offering a fresh perspective rather than just reworking what's come before. Still it is very well made and incredibly enjoyable hence the 8* rating.",A,10/01/2025

Like all the films in the franchise, I'm a viewer who thought the supporting characters were more interesting, but never given enough time to shine (but thank god these films were not three hours long to explore that).

You need to understand that a movie is always going to be an interpretation of the source material and with that I really applaud this movie with it's dedication to trying to be as accurate and canon as possible. Shadows backstory was beautifully and accurately portrayed apart from the asteroid which was a different interpretation. Keanu's Shadow really added that badass dark awesome counterpart to Jim's silly and goofy Eggman. I was so stoked as a diehard sonic fan myself since I was a child to see Sonic battling it out with Shadow. The motorcycle and gun reference from his debut game was SO sick to see and the akira motorcycle slide was such a good touch. I liked seeing sonic's progression in the story from getting his butt kicked by shadow to getting better and going toe to toe as he turns super sonic. It was so badass to see them go super and fight across the world i was GEEKED. I was even more geeked as they team up and fight the robots in space while LIVE AND LEARN WAS PLAYINGGGG. I understand that it's a movie so it's going to be a remix but it was still SO GOOD. ESPECIALLY with the Sonic Adventure 2 reference where they are both super in space. Such an amazing homage to the classic 3D sonic games that would have any diehard sonic fan like myself GEEKED. I have NEVER felt more excited watching a movie before than I was when I witnessed sonic and shadow fighting like dragon ball z characters in space. I was insanely geeked I was quite literally tweaking in pure bliss watching this such an amazing interpretation of the Sonic series. The best so far in the franchise IMO. As well as the ending credit scene introducing metal sonic and amy OH MY GOD THEY BOTH LOOK SO GOOD. Amy has PEAK design she reminded me of Ramona Flowers with her big hammer in the Scott Pilgrim anime on netflix. SHE LOOKS SO SICK, honestly such a good take on a character that was more seen as annoying, she is such a girlboss in that scene it was so cool to see. Plus metal sonic is such a peak character they got him 100% accurate to his source material he looks absolutely menacing and amazing as well. And to top it off they add a SECOND post credit scene which really shows their love for making this movie as good as possible not even Marvel does that anymore including 2 post credits.

There were a few things in the film that bothered me, especially because it's a children's movie, like when they were playing chess towards the end, to pass a gate or something, why did Ron have to ''sacrifice'' himself?

His biggest character trait is that even though he is met with failure time and time again, he stays motivated and becomes one of the most fastest developing bladers.nnThere are some aspects of the anime that I do not like. One of them is the beys in this series are treated more like hardware than partners compared to the prior serieses.",A,09/01/2025

The only unanswered questions is if she also has a good sex drive and excitement as the good Doctor . Amazing episode anyway. This is definitely one of the most perfect episodes this series had offers me after 6 seasons of excitement and pure joy. Good Doctor is definitely Netflix best series actually.,A,09/01/2025
rw10250407,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"Nosferatu at times successfully creates the gothic atmosphere ghoulishly befitting of the infamous eldritch genre and setting. However, it struggles to tell a tale that surpasses the by-now overdone possession trope, which has aged significantly since the original classic 1922 film, released about a century ago now. What terrified the audience of the past probably only tickles the audience of the present, I felt unmoved by jump scares and the run-of-the-mill macabre imagery of spasmodic convulsions and blood. This retelling of an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula' takes the story from silent to audible, and certainly ups the visual ante - which goes without saying; but doesn't do much else. Critic and historian Kim Newman declared the original as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film; but this old-school template has since been taken in a hundred different directions, leaving the old classic feeling outshined and simple by comparison.nnSo many nineteenth-century horror novels work on the uncertainty of perception, with darkness, flickering firelight, huge projected shadows, mists and rains, gales and thunderstorms, all obscuring what one can see and hear. Here, the darkness of the lighting is almost always daringly low that it quickly becomes OTT; gas lamps and candles are pretty sparing, even for the early 19th century setting. It was getting to the point where it felt like shuffling around in the dark looking for a light switch, the dark was perpetual and monotonous. Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) sounds like he has COPD, taking belaboured inhalations between sentences that listening to his dialogue is borderline grating, the lexicon of the time is used but the Count is rarely insightful or interesting. The other characters' dialogue follows suit, bearing limited resemblance to Stoker's powerful prose. Friedrich Harding (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Prof. Albin Eberhart Von Franz (Willem Dafoe) and Dr. Wilhelm Sievers' (Ralph Ineson) exchange about superstition states the obvious tensions between science and magic, these tensions could have been articulated in a far more compelling way as a recurrent theme of the storytelling.nnThe cinematography, set design, and costume design is next level, but without a good story threading it together, these efforts are wasted. The overabundance of greys, blacks, and dark corners is intended to conceal the horrors lying in wait, but because the object of horror is quite predictable, it doesn't land quite as intended.nnOverall, Nosferatu (2024) is missing the right dialogue, modern twists, and impactful screenplay to make it competitive in the modern horror genre. The film could be at least 30 minutes shorter. There are spades more 'creepy' and 'disgusting' or revulsive than truly 'scary', per se.",A,09/01/2025

I knew what all the other characters were doing for the last 25 years but not Guy and Gerald. Also, turning Guy bisexual and having a fiancee was annoying!

I understand that the world hasn't been fair to women, and it's terrible-it's a critical issue that deserves thoughtful exploration. However, this film completely failed to address it in a meaningful or impactful way. Instead of shedding light on the problem or offering insight, it felt superficial, disjointed, and almost dismissive of the gravity of the situation. It lacked depth, coherence, and the sensitivity needed to do justice to such an important topic. Honestly, it left me feeling frustrated and disappointed!!!!",A,09/01/2025

If a person can do that, then this period drama is worthy of your attention. The chemistry between the ML and FL is mesmerizing at times and always fascinating. There are no intrusive second or third couples taking away from the main story arc. That happens to be one of my biggest peeves with c-dramas: spending time introducing new couples to the story rather than developing the main couple's relationship.nnThe quality of The Double has made it one of my favorite Chinese period dramas, along with The Story of Yanxi Palace. It is no coincidence that the same actress stars in both dramas: Wu Jinyan. She helps make both dramas soar. In The Double, she and her male costar, Wang Xingyue, convincingly portray a woman and a man who develop a strong connection based on mutual respect.nnI like happy endings and not ambiguous ones, so this is the one aspect of The Double that I will 'knock.'.

rw10250286,tt4772188,Straume (2024),"Flow, directed by Latvian director Gints Zilbalodis, is a captivating white-knuckle survival adventure set in a world on the brink of ruin. Told entirely without dialogue, the story follows a cat evolving from self-preservation to solidarity with a motley crew of other species. Acquired out of Cannes for North America by Sideshow and Janus Films, Flow is a piece with Zilbalodis' 2019 debut Away, both being silent movies and oweing a debt to animation master Hayao Miyazaki. The new work drops characters designed in classic cartoon style into ravishing photo-realistic environments, resembling the woodsy landscapes of Danish artist Peder Mørk Mønsted. The cat at the center of the story is a skinny gray feline of indeterminate gender, clever and resilient but also skittish. It discovers the origin of the artworks in an isolated cottage with a wood carver's workshop and eventually climbs onto higher ground, eventually scaling the sculpture that dominates the skyline. Flow is an eventful journey, propulsively paced yet never rushed, giving breathing room to nail-biting interludes and more touching moments. The cat hops onto a beaten up sailboat and travels up a swollen river, gradually adapting to the challenges of this new waterworld. The animals pass ruins of what appears to be a grand ancient city with a massive amphitheater that's home to a colony of lemurs, each of them sporting its own found treasures as accessories. Flow is a film that explores the transformation of all animals on a boat, except for the capybara, who remains a simple, easygoing animal. The labrador, a smarter and more alert dog, becomes more alert to the safety of its fellow travelers. The cat, the most perceptible change, cohabitates with other species, fostering a communal spirit. The film is suitable for children and adults, as it demonstrates the importance of friendship and mutual trust. The animation by Zilbalodis and Léo Silly-Pélissier creates a picture-book world amidst natural disaster and death, with vibrant textures and enchanting underwater scenes. The visual aesthetic is polished, yet the film still manages to appear both technically accomplished and hand-crafted. The attention to movement is extraordinary, with graceful, controlled camerawork and character detail resulting from extensive study of each animal's behavior and physicality. The score by Zilbalodis and Rihards Zal shifts from beautiful passages of percussive melody to flights of stirring strings, blending humorous observations with moments of high anxiety or tragedy. Flow is a joy to experience and a deeply affecting story, the work of a unique talent who deserves to be ranked among the world's great animation artists.",A,09/01/2025

Well, there you go.nnTake 2 cups of the 1970s Confessions sex comedies, a couple of tablespoons of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, 100mg of Brideshead Revisited, a dash of Grange Hill, a few pinches of James Bond and a soupçon of Phantom of the Opera. Mix it all together and what you have is a nasty brown sludge.nnIt was filmed in 2009 but it has a real 1970s vibe to it. Plenty of gratuitous sexism, racism and classism and a chunk of sexual assault. The one black guy gets off fairly lightly but there is a gormless Welsh girl with the world's worst mock-Barry accent, and a pair of 'comedy' oriental girls, to name but 3.nnThey have shamelessly aped Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure in the 2 ostensibly comic characters, though what they are doing in such a supposedly august college only the script writer knows.nnThe mad scientist has a cupboard full of puppets which he has to burn on a bonfire. We never find out why. It's a pity, as they were less wooden than most of the acting.nnThe screenplay seems to have been written by a teenager.

rw10250234,tt21823606,A Real Pain (2024),"Most of the time, when watching a movie-even one based on real events-it can be hard to imagine how those situations might occur in your own life. However, with this movie, even though the specific pain of the Holocaust is not something I've directly experienced, I was able to empathize with the characters' emotions and see how similar dynamics play out in my daily life or in the lives of those around me.nnI believe this connection is largely due to how the story is told. Instead of revealing the characters' histories and emotions all at once, the movie creates a sense of duality. This is achieved through excellent dialogues and Jesse Eisenberg's direction, which ensures that every scene leaves a significant emotional impact on the viewer.nnSpeaking of the performances, both lead actors were outstanding, but I believe Kieran Culkin stood out the most. His portrayal allowed the audience to understand the layers of his character while also leaving room for ambiguity. Jesse Eisenberg also delivered a strong performance, though it felt somewhat familiar, resembling his usual ""quirky"" or ""awkward"" character archetypes seen in previous roles.nnThe supporting characters and the way their relationships and opinions about the main characters evolve throughout the movie-depending on the events and revelations-are another highlight. This is a great achievement of the script, which adds depth not only to the main characters but also to the movie as a whole.nnIn the end, much like the journey the characters go through, watching this film was a sensitive yet enriching experience. It allowed me to grasp the deeper complexities of the story and its emotional resonance.",A,09/01/2025
rw10250211,tt26676571,"""Yellowjackets"" (2021) {Two Truths and a Lie (#2.5)}","I'm rewatching this show for the second time since season 3 is coming out soon, that being said I remember finishing this season and not really caring for a season 3. At this point every plot is moving way too slow, there are so many scenes that don't add anything to the plot or story or character development. This show presents itself as a dark, psychological thriller we're the characters are forced to do horrible disturbing things, with a little bit of supernatural aspect to it as well. I'm anxiously waiting for the show to reach the point of where they are actually hunting eachother and doing the messed up things they are always hinting they did out there to survive. At this point I hate Travis character. He is such a whiny baby that every 5 minutes has a new stick up his butt & blames Natalie, who is always nagging him. It's unrealistic to me that her character would be so d*ck whipped and into babying him. His character and casting truly is the worst part of the show for me. They take up so much time of the show and that's just one thing that is beyond annoying me about this show. Misty's new friend is insanely annoying and acts like a Disney character. If they want people to stop making fun of them, they would realistically try harder not to be weird annoying losers. And the all time worst part of the show is Shauna's ugly, mean unlikable daughter who dresses like she shops at Fred Meyer. ANOTHER unrealistic part of the show. Teens don't dress or act like she does and if they do they don't have boyfriends or go out or even have friends. The angsty teen who is always mad at her parents is such an old cliche I wish shows would stop doing. If I treated my mom that way I wouldn't have a phone or even a bedroom door.nnOverall, that being said the show needs to focus on the actual plot and point to it. That they did messed up things out there and they need to hurry up and get to that part in season 3.",A,09/01/2025
rw10250198,tt9218128,Gladiator II (2024),"This movie has insurmountable flaws in my view. The most problematic for me was Paul Mescal's unconvincing rage. The original film succeeded largely on the strength of Crowe's performance in the Maximus role. The character was underwritten, but Crowe's glowering made for a compelling revenge tale. Here, Mescal is too mild and lacking in the intensity needed to carry this film. I'm sure the plan was for Washington and Pascal to subsidize the charisma that Mescal lacked, but they are too peripheral to the story to properly compensate for a weak lead.nnThe elegant simplicity of the original film is replaced here with a convoluted plot where the motivations of the characters are often not given enough emphasis. Maximus wanted to kill Commodus to get revenge in the original. No matter the complications and subplots, the original film succeeded by giving Maximus's revenge plot its primary focus. Here, however, everything is too scattered. Lucius ostensibly wants revenge for his wife's death, but this isn't given much attention and doesn't even carry through to the film's conclusion. Instead, the protagonist's goal shifts and the antagonist that he should focus on is rarely clear. This results in a narrative that I personally found only sporadically interesting.nnEven when it comes to surface-level pleasures, I feel the film largely comes up short. I didn't expect any lines as iconic as ""Are you not entertained?"" or ""Am I not merciful?"" That said, the dialogue was simply excruciatingly longwinded and lacking in texture or depth. Who would ever quote a line such as ""The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury?"" Even when uttered by Denzel Washington, the dialogue is simply not attention-grabbing. The performances are inconsistent with each other with every actor's style clashing with the others. Denzel is the most charismatic, but he makes little attempt to blend in with the setting.nnSpeaking of setting, watching this back to back with the original film serves to emphasize how lacking in detail and texture the sets are in this film compared to the original. The furnishings and costumes are sparse and uninspired here, sadly. The action scenes, likewise, are mediocre at best. Given the complaints of rampant historical inaccuracy, one would expect Scott to at least strive for enthusiastic action schlock. The fights, however, are uninspired in their choreography, utterly lacking in stakes, and grimly predictable in their execution. There wasn't a moment that quickened my heartbeat or inspired more than casual interest on my part. If you're going to flood the Colloseum with bloodthirsty sharks, forget about restraint and give the audience a great time for heaven's sake!nnAt almost 2 1/2 hours, I was mostly not entertained, thank you very much, Maximus!",A,09/01/2025

It was obvious that the film was rushed to release before it was truly ready, as several plot points were left unresolved. A prime example of this is the opening scene, which is set as a flashback but is never revisited or explained in the course of the movie, leaving viewers confused and disappointed. This oversight speaks volumes about the lack of proper planning and attention to detail in the storyline.nnAfter the massive success of the first part, expectations were sky-high, but this sequel falls short in every aspect. The narrative feels fragmented, and the pacing is all over the place, making it hard to stay engaged. It's clear that the film relied heavily on the success of the first installment to drive its box office numbers, rather than delivering a solid and well-crafted story. The lack of a cohesive script and a clear vision for the characters and plot makes this film feel like a missed opportunity.nnUnfortunately, the movie's only saving grace is the momentum built by the success of Pushpa 1.

rw10249893,tt27436132,Identity (2025),"Synopsis of this review - While the overall movie is visually stunning and seems promising in the beginning with a lot of scientific jargon thrown in good measure, you have a feeling at the end of the movie that many of the scenes are forced and the script writers are found lacking in terms of the premises they chose (the movie would have still made sense without the OCD part), the way they force scenes onto you just to make their job easier and a lack of logic throughout.nnSome of the questions I was left pondering over at the end of the movie:nn1) Why OCD?nnHaving watched films like 'North 24 Kaatham' and 'Hey Jude' just to mention a couple of them in Malayalam, this movie really doesn't require that premise to carry the story forward. It was probably used to confuse the viewers, but at the end of the day an air marshal would find it difficult to operate if he had OCD. It is very likely that the rigorous screening to get into such a job would filter out such people, whether you like it or not. You don't need to have OCD to be a good sketch artist or an air marshal. On the contrary, you would expect people with OCD have a tough time concentrating, among many other shortcomings, for doing such a job. Being a perfectionist is different from having OCD. If this was done to get the viewers to sympathise with Haran, I would say he didn't need.nn2) Writers resort to a form of 'deus ex machina' or a form of 'plot convenience'?nnA) The antagonist randomly gets to live in the same building as the antagonist and the protagonist then gets assigned for no obvious reason to sketch in a police investigation in front of the antagonist. Would have made a lot more sense if this was all planned by either one of them.nnB) How was it that all the witnesses were on the same flight without neither the police nor the army knowing?nnC) How could the antagonist be sure that the plane would crash for sure, and even if it did, that all the witnesses would die especially on the ground? Blackmailing one of the pilots would have made more sense.nnD) Mentioning during one of the most important scenes that the projected super villain is not the real one in just one dialogue.nnE) This is a sensitive topic, and even the supervillain had doubts with this. Would the threat of posting explicit videos of a family member drive people to commit to such extreme obedience? This seems like it is from the 80s 90s era. It can still happen now, but you can't be sure.nnF) Alisha being hit by a truck randomly?nnG) Hard drive corrupted because Allen was in the XRay room? Too convenient?nn3) Logical failures?nnA) Why did Alisha think that Haran was trying to kill her? She clearly saw the molester blackmailing the ATCO before Haran burnt down the warehouse.nnB) Why did Haran draw his own portrait the first time? Allen was smoking in a corner and not looking at the sketch. Haran could have easily modified the sketch to look like someone else. I understand that it was a revelation to himself that Alisha was a witness, but still could have managed to pull this off being as smart as he is.nnC) After Haran manages to run Allen off the road into a cliff during the car chase, he seems to be not looking at the road and then when he looks back holds his arm covering his head as if to suggest an impending collision. But later it is shown that he walks out of his car to check on Allen and he gets shot right in his chest which looks lethal with blood splattering. A couple of scenes/days later Haran is shown perfectly alright.nnD) If it was that easy for Allen to adopt a new identity and vanish into thin air, why go to all this trouble?nnE) Haran being such a great sketch artist should have got Alisha to describe the face of the ATCO and sketched it himself and let someone else match it with the passengers rather than letting her figure it out knowing that she has problems with just that.nn4) Random musings/Loose threads?nnA) What was Haran planning to do by picking the lock of the apartment Alisha was living in? Does not show any clear motive.nnB) I'm not entirely sure about this and I'll give the benefit of doubt to the writers. But if Allen spoke to Alisha when he came to pick her up assuming she would think he is Haran because he was disguised as Haran, I'm sure Alisha should have been able to differentiate them with their voice. If this scene is not in the movie it could have been used to elevate the movie by portraying that she is in doubt.nnC) What was the chain that Allen handed over to Mandira Bedi and what was their relationship?nnD) Why the fascination with r*pe videos used as tools to control people?nnE) Why cut short the narrative of Alisha having mistaken Allen for Haran (which would have made the film's title 'Identity' a lot more sensible) so easily in a few scenes? Starting the movie with mistaken identities and then finally setting them right would have made the movie superlative.nnConclusion - I only went to the trouble of writing this long review because I saw potential.

rw10249766,tt0268978,A Beautiful Mind (2001),"Yeah - don't get it. With an 8.2 score on iMDB you'd think this would have more on offer than cinematic goose fat. The beginning is unbelievably unengaging, you never buy Russel Crowe's character, until he's aged suitably old enough where his crumminess becomes naturally organic. Maybe it's because they let Crowe speak in his native Australian pipes, that's where the issue comes in, as it sounds dissonant when every other actor doesn't have this offputting mumble to their line deliveries. It does pick up a good swing to itself in the latter half, where his schizophrenic condition takes centre stage and Jennifer Connelly has to put on the nanny act as the wife, every time Ed Harris shows up it becomes fun and even comedic to imagine how this all looked on set. Maybe I'm just too unmoved to have any expressed sympathies for the real story of John Nash, an esteemed mathematician who lived and died in esteem, because everything I took out of A Beautiful Mind is likely the wrong message.nnI will say, even if this does spell out little I cared for the actual content of the film itself, that I like the poster they use for it, where Crowe takes up half the image and you see a small shadowy of Ed Harris, blurred into oblivion, only identifiable by his black fedora. It gives a nice touch to the subplot of John Nash wrestling with his debilitating schizophrenia condition, like phantoms are always entrapping him, keeping him stuck in his own mind that isn't actually all that beautiful. Even in the supposedly triumphant ending, when his longtime friend at Princeton University haggles John's wife along with him to watch the man - in his seventies mind you - talking to a table of students still in that mumble mumble voice, and since he's talking to them openly and without death daggers you're supposed to have tummy flutters. Except he's still conversing and explaining as though he's the most shaken-up, neurotic teacher in the world, a mathematical genius who presents himself as though there's no correct solution to anything.",A,09/01/2025

Jentry not only defeats ghosts and demons, but she also uncovers the mystery of her parents' deaths and explores stunning yet terrifying new realms. The show does an amazing job at balancing the plot with the world-building, introducing new conflicts and new settings with each episode.nnPlease give Jentry Chau a chance.

rw10249592,tt0371606,Chicken Little (2005),"Ooh, boy, do I have a lot to say about Chicken Little.nnWhat's the story?nnChicken Little is a pariah among the townspeople of Oakey Oaks because of how he mistook an acorn for a piece of the sky and caused mass hysteria. After one year of being tormented by the extremely petty townspeople, he suddenly wins their affections after winning a baseball game. After this, aliens land on Earth and leave their child behind. Chicken Little, his friends, and his dad (who believe me, we WILL get to later) have to return the alien child to his parents before the town can be destroyed.nnThat's the first issue with the movie. The story is so disjointed and lazy. First, it's about an outcast kid trying to prove himself to everyone around him. He accomplishes that in the first 20 minutes. Then, all of a sudden, it's about an alien invasion. Seriously, were the writers just picking story ideas out of a hat?nnThen there's the animation. For Disney's first fully CG film, this is not a good start. The character designs look very unappealing, and the backgrounds look like something out of an early 2000's morning/afternoon cartoon (think Veggietales or Jimmy Neutron) While those were good for the budget they had, Chicken Little is a theatrical film from a huge animation studio. Surely they could do better than this!nnThe very worst thing about this movie, though, is the characters and the overall mood. Chicken Little has very little in the way of personality, to the point that, even though the entire world was in danger of being destroyed, I didn't feel any tension about it. His pig friend is extremely annoying. Many times when he opened his mouth, I found myself facepalming and begging him to shut up. Unfortunately, he provides most of the film's ""humor"" (which is made up of nothing but pop culture references and jokes related to bodily functions). Then there's Buck Cluck. Yeah, there's a reason he's one of the most hated Disney characters. He's a cowardly loser who cares more about his own reputation than he does about his own son. He discourages his son from trying new activities, he constantly treats him as a disappointment, and he doesn't even bother to stand up for him when the entire town mocks him and treats him as an outcast. Seriously, why am I supposed to sympathize with this guy? Sure, he apologizes to his son near the end, but that hardly makes up for his awful treatment of him throughout the first two acts. Really, the only supporting characters I found somewhat amusing were Abby and the fish.nnThere's also the mood of the movie. My gosh, this has got to be the most cynical and depressing movie Disney has ever made. Essentially, a bunch of people relentlessly torment a literal child for one small mistake. They even make a whole movie-within-a-movie about it. Seriously, how cruel and petty do you have to be to think that's okay? Then, they suddenly worship Chicken Little when he wins a baseball game, only to turn their backs on him when he tries to warn them about the sky falling again. What is the message of this movie supposed to be? If you suspect something bad is happening, don't bother telling anyone because nobody will believe you? That is NOT a good message to be teaching children. Also, the movie fails as an underdog story. Sure, Disney has done stories where the main characters were outcasts (take Dumbo or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, for example), but even those characters had kind and compassionate people by their side who provided hope to them and showed them that they are inherently worthy of respect just by being themselves. Chicken Little has to actively risk his life against a bunch of aliens in order for anyone to respect him again. Overall, this story is way too cruel, especially for Disney.nnNeedless to say, I won't be watching this one again. If you want to see a good Chicken Little adaptation from Disney, their 1943 short film of the same name does a much better job of translating the original story to animation.",A,09/01/2025

The wait only deepened my obsession, prompting endless theories about what might happen next.nnStellar Acting and Captivating CharactersnThe lead actors brought their A-game, but it was the male lead who truly stole the show. His nuanced portrayal of a complex character moved me deeply. The chemistry between the leads was electric, making every interaction feel genuine and heart-wrenching. Their performances elevated the story, making it impossible not to root for them despite the challenges they faced.nnA Story That Hooks YounThe drama's plot, while sometimes labeled as ""Wattpad-coded,"" was undeniably addictive. It struck a perfect balance between heart-fluttering romance, tension, and moments of introspection. Yes, the themes may have leaned into familiar tropes, but they were handled with such charm and sincerity that it felt fresh and deeply personal.nnThe Ending: A Near-Perfect ClosurenWhile I loved the finale, I couldn't help but wish for an added layer of emotional depth. A scene where their son mirrored the stoic demeanor of Baek Yoo Yeon during his birthday photoshoot would have been a beautiful touch, adding a poignant callback to his father's character arc. Including this moment during the housewarming party would have tied the narrative together seamlessly, offering a more satisfying resolution.nnUnfair CriticismnIt's disheartening that the drama has faced criticism for its supposed ""wattpad-coded theme"" and mistranslations during its finale. These detractors overlook the emotional impact, the stellar acting, and the incredible storytelling that made this drama resonate with so many fans. The themes may not be groundbreaking, but their execution was heartfelt, making it a memorable experience for viewers like me.nnFinal ThoughtsnIt isn't just a drama-it's an experience. It's the kind of show that keeps you thinking long after the credits roll, that makes you laugh, cry, and fall in love all over again. While no drama is perfect, this one came close for me.

There are a few changes to make it more accessible for a general audience, but overall, it stays true to the original story. Second, and I want to emphasize this: you need to pay attention to the entire storyline, not just the romance or the kidnapping. It's essential to understand the story of each character. Many people were disappointed with the final episode, but that's because they didn't pay enough attention. From the very first episode, it's mentioned that the male lead previously worked as a war correspondent an hostage negotiator in Argan (a fictional country)Later, he became a spokesperson, and the series begins with him addressing the kidnappings.

But the substance of the show is much more problematic. Set aside producers exploiting what's worst in people, but to see how so many adults are losing their mind and pride over slim possibility to win some money is sickening.nnAccording to the main host and his entourage the money is the GOD and to see their genuine disgust and disbelief that someone can choose loyalty over money is extremely sad.nnIf you want to see how people can be manipulative, greedy, corrupt or just plain evil, while engaging in some games, this show is for you.",A,09/01/2025
rw10249329,tt20215968,Hit Man (2023),"Am really surprised by how much I liked this movie, given my initial impression of the trailer was that it seemed like ANOTHER ""spy and assassin falls in love"" story. It's not. Hit Man takes this premise and turns it on its head giving us a really compelling and interesting story that had me glued to the screen for its breezy two-ish hours run time.nnIt's an inherently interesting tale: a man, Gary (Glen Powell) is a philosophy professor who through a sequence of events, becomes an informant for the police, essentially entrapping individuals who are interested in hiring hit men to solve all manner of personal and financial problems. He meets a prospective ""client"" he takes a liking to, and of course, shenanigans ensue.nnHowever, it's the excellent script and performances that take this movie over the top. Look, I'm a film nerd: tell me Richard Linklater is making a movie and I will watch it. Linklater's finger prints all over this thing; it miraculously manages to retain his breezy ""hang out"" film style, with excellent dialog and a penchant for exploring interesting ideas so naturally.nnCase and point, when Gary and Madison (Adria Arjona) first meet, the dialog is absolutely phenomenal and it's obvious from the first lines (and not because, let's be real, Arjona is stunning) that these two have chemistry. Linklater writes dialog between men and women that basically defined how I wished my dates would go since I was a high schooler for a reason.nnBut, aside from that, the movie manages to really imbue some fascinating ideas in what is a relatively simple story (my favourite kind of writing technique). Hit Man is ultimately a meditation on morality, love, human nature, and ethical consistency; it doesn't preach or force you to feel a certain way, but cleverly reveals all of these themes to you to chew on. And, then there's the nuts and bolts of a good story with escalating stakes and twists and all of that. Maybe it was Glen Powell who kept this thing grounded (he shares the writing credit); but it certainly feels like a Linklater film with a bit more structure.nnThe performances are also fantastic. Powell is deservedly becoming one of Hollywood's most recognizable stars and he really shines here. All actors really want a movie like this; where he/she can play many characters and show off their range, but it's in the subtle distinctions between Gary and Ron (the hit man he plays) that really sold the performance for me.nnAdria Arjona is great and her chemistry with Powell is electric. I don't think this movie would be as sexy as it is without her and she manages to have a darkness to her that is utterly fascinating. I also really liked - and amazingly - found myself kind of empathizing with Austin Amelio's Jasper (the antagonist of this movie, essentially), and a lot of that has to do with his performance. Something about the man's desperate eyes made me feel bad for him.nnYeah, this thing was great. It's really unfortunate it didn't get a theatrical release, but hopefully it gets a big audience on Netflix, and we get more of these adult oriented romantic dramedies.",A,09/01/2025

I personally think if Flanagan wanted to remake Dark Shadows he'd be the perfect one. If there was any gripe i have with this show is that it needed to be longer. A lot longer for me anyway. This show could easily have done 22 episodes if it wanted. Netflix Flanagan shows are only 1 season so if it had to only end with 1 id rather this show be longer. The thing i like the most about this flanagan show more than any other of his is the fact that he uses a monster instead of a haunted ghost house story. It also has a very 80s vibe to it because it's location setting and atmosphere. Its a different kind of vampire story as well which has more a folklore type feel to it. It is for me a 10/10 best horror show ive seen in many years. Flanagan needs to make a witch or werewolf series now and keep this going.",A,09/01/2025

rw10249143,tt0490215,Silence (2016/I),"I've never written an IMDb review before but I just had to for Silence after seeing it only had a 7.2. In my opinion, Silence is a top 3 Marty film and a masterpiece. It's by far his most thought provoking film, beautifully shot, has amazing performances especially from Andrew Garfield, and super well written. It didn't even feel that slow considering it is almost 3 hours. No scene felt like a waist. A profound and powerful film on religion. I truly am clueless as to how this has a 7.2. I'll insert my main review here:nA powerful film on religion. Religion brings people comfort, hope, and comradery but also brings conflict, division, pain, and oppression. This film asks an important question. Is your faith worth more than human life? Is preserving human life the greatest act of faith? If we confine ourselves into something that we aren't, our lives will become meaningless or unfulfilling. Because of this, we must always hold on to who we are under all circumstances. But is preserving who we are worth it if it means that others are harmed in the process. I, like many of the characters in this film am very conflicted with how I feel about these topics. Silence is by far Scorsese's deepest and most thought provoking film and also possibly the most beautifully shot. Andrew Garfield knocks it out of the park. He flawlessly portrays a man seeing his world come crashing down with doubts of the very thing he has dedicated his life to. Everyone in this delivers an amazing performance. Even if you are forced to hide something far away from anyone, don't let it go. Truly profound.",A,09/01/2025

The Dogme 95 filming style sometimes felt uncomfortable but made me feel as though I was living Selma's life myself. The film leaves a lingering question: Was Selma right? Was the death sentence the correct decision?nnFor me, it was a sad yet reasonable ending given the circumstances and the world Selma lived in.

Possibly demob happy, I mistakenly uploaded number 26 of the first series, and it was twelve minutes before I realised I'd seen it before, just three weeks earlier.nnRobert Vaughn is fine but he has to carry it virtually single handed, apart from guest stars. Nyree Dawn Porter has played some good roles but here she is too genteel and haughty, and at the risk of sounding sexist, a teeny bit old. In Your Witness (S1 E23) she fiddles with a cigarette case while Harry fights two thugs. Good grief it's 1972 not 1872. Contrary to what is claimed in the IMDb mini bio, another Emma Peel she is certainly not. What the show needed was a groovy dolly bird, if you'll excuse my 1970s lingo. Imogen Hassall could have given Mrs Peel a run for her money. The third team member Paul (Tony Anholt) is a handsome nonentity.nnThat said, a few are worth watching:nKing Con (S1 E8). Smooth conman Anton Rodgers cons a friend of Caroline and is then conned by the team. Splendid comic turn by Vaughn as a reckless gambler.nnVocal (1 E20). Temporarily blinded, Paul is tricked by a drug dealing gang, whose boss is an accomplished mimic, convincing him he is talking to Harry. More hard edged than usual, an out of character Caroline fells the Harry imitator with a karate chop.nnBurning Bush (S2 E18). Harry imitates a drunken tramp to infiltrate a religious sect to rescue an impressionable girl who has been taken in. Good performance from Sinead Cusack, and Vaughan acts outside his usual suave persona.nnThe aforementioned Your Witness is worth a look, if only because Stephanie Beacham is in it, a rare bit of eye candy.

He can't get the money for the book he translated from the publishing house, he can't get his doctoral thesis accepted by the jury members, and most importantly, he has to take care of his uncle who is a blind bookseller... The first character turning point occurs during the conversation with Altug. For the first time Burak reveals his will to start a new life. Although he has not yet finalised his decision to leave city life, his will becomes decisive for the rest of the film.nnThe plot of the film also supports the realisation of the will stated at the first character turning point of Burak. In the tension that starts with the divorce process of Altug and Ece, Ece moves to the house of Selin, Burak's ex-wife. When Altug burns the carpet in Selin's house by making it look like a burglary to intimidate her, Selin accuses her ex-husband Burak of passivity and uselessness in life. Although Burak tries to stay away from tension and negative energies, he cannot do it. Therefore, both Ece and Altug's divorce process and the tension with his uncle serve the same purpose. The first character's turning point - Burak's ability to realise his will to leave city life and start a new life. At this point, Burak cannot leave because of the responsibility of taking care of his uncle who is hanging over him like the sword of Damocles.nnAfter Serkan informs him that Altug has been kidnapped for ransom, Burak is forced to confront his past.

Their happy and quiet lives are soon destroyed due to a sudden tragic event and the two mothers become suspicious of each other's actions. They begin to question the relationships they once held so dear. Guilt, suspicion and paranoia combine to unravel their sisterly bond. Sometimes it's the only thing you can trust!nnA mother's pain takes on an unimaginable dimension in this dark psychological thriller, starring Oscar winners Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, which delves into the limits of friendship, hatred, fear and revenge. Set in the 1960s, with evocative settings, our protagonists, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, adequately play two housewives with two children of the same age and they all seem to live a dream life but the perfect harmony of life is suddenly broken after a tragic accident. It is a simple and direct film in which the psychological observations and the character study of the two protagonists stand out. But the plot is lightly developed and vaguely narrated without the necessary and indispensable suspense and tension required in this type of thriller, resulting in a story that seems more like the typical afternoon television movie to take a nap.nnBased on the book titled ¨Mother's Instinct¨ (""Derriére la haine""), a suspense novel written by Barbara Abel, while the film is set in the 1960s, the original story is set in the 2010s; dealing with mental health, grieving the death of a loved one and the overwhelming power of a mother's love taken to the limit. The novel was already adapted to film in 2018 in the superior Franco-Belgian adaptation entitled Duelles (2018) by Olivier Masset-Depasse with Veerle Baetens and Anne Coesens, which won a record 9 Magritte Awards (out of 10 nominations) at the 2020 «Magritte Du Cinema»: Best Film Best Director (Olivier Masset-Dépasse) Best Leading Actress (Veerle Baetens) Best Supporting Actor (Arieh Worthalter), among others.nnPerfect Lives (2024) was professionally directed - in his debut film - by Benoît Delhomme, although it is nothing out of the ordinary. Apart from the dazzling and colorful photography done by the director himself, he merely copies the French film, not adding any originality and merely recreating the events with a certain caution and without adding enough intrigue, with a rather predictable result. Delhomme is a prestigious cameraman with a long career. Benoit's first major success as a cinematographer came with his film for Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung, ""The Scent of Green Papaya,"" which won the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film. Following that success, Benoit worked with the same director again for ""Cyclo."" Next came ""The Loss of Sexual Innocence,"" a bold collage of daring images shot in three weeks in three different countries. Soon after, ""The Winslow Boy,"" a highly painterly adaptation of an Edwardian play directed by David Mamet. Then, a biopic about the scandalous Marquis de Sade during the French Revolution directed by Benoit Jacquot (""Sade""), followed by a ghost story on the streets of Taipei with revered Taiwanese director Tsai Ming Liang (""What Time Is It There?""). And an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"" with Al Pacino and an extremely stylish western shot in the Australian outback, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat (""The Proposal""). Followed by a tragic love story between the son of a concentration camp commandant and a Jewish boy (""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"") and a highly experimental film adapted from Oscar Wilde's ""Salome"" directed by Al Pacino. As well as a biopic of cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking directed by Oscar-winning director James Marsh and starring Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar for best actor for this performance (""The Theory of Everything"") and continuing with ""At Eternity's Gate"" about the life of Vincent Van Gogh filmed entirely handheld by Benoit in Provence under the direction of painter and director Julian Schnabel, among other films. The Mother's Instinct (2024) rating: 5.5/10. The film will appeal to fans of Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.",A,09/01/2025
rw10248892,tt9253284,"""Andor"" (2022)","Andor is a spy thriller show created by Tony Gilroy, who also wrote Rogue One and the Bourne movies. To be honest, I never cared about a supporting character from Rogue One, but I always wanted Star Wars to focus on the repercussions of war. Andor has given me exactly that.nnAndor is a show that focuses on the rebels and their struggles during the empire era while giving an insight into how the empire deals with them. Andor shows that rebellion comes with a price, and sometimes, the line between rebels and empire can be very fragile. Andor is the first project in a decade that has made the Empire smart and scary again. I have never seen Star Wars so mature and gritty before. Andor just didn't feel like it belonged to the same universe. The plot is very well crafted, and every action of the characters has consequences.nnEveryone in this show has played their role so perfectly that I cannot praise them and the casting directors, Nina Gold (Chernobyl, Game of Thrones, The Crown) and Martin Ware (Baby Reindeer), enough.nnAll the actors have taken their work seriously. Stellan Skarsgard as Luthen, Andy Serkis as Kino Loy, Fiona Shaw as Maarva Andor, and Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma have stolen the show. They have been given a remarkable script by Tony Gilroy, and they know it. They have done their best to adapt that script on the screen.nnThe Past/Present Suite by Nicholas Britell (Succession) is a score to listen to. It's stuck in my head.nnThe budget of Andor was also very high, and it has made the best use of it, which is why it also looks costly. Production designer Luke Hull (Chernobyl) has made the environment feel grand and believable with his amazing set designs. Costume designer Michael Wilkinson (300, Watchmen, Batman vs. Superman) has put every detail in the costumes of the characters. It feels like a lot of thought and effort has been put into this show.nnOf course, it's not perfect like a 100/100 show. The pacing of Andor sometimes becomes a bit slow. It's because the show was divided into three episodes mini-arcs. So, after finishing an arc, the story starts developing another one, which makes the pacing slow. But this is much better than having amateurish writing and rushed development. Plans and conspiracies unfold slowly, piece by piece. So, you have to pay attention to what the characters are saying.nnThe actor playing Cassian Andor, Diego Luna, is not given much of a dynamic role. This is why the supporting actors outshine him a lot. Again, those actors are very good, and this is just me nitpicking.nnOverall, Andor is a show that highly surprised me. I cannot believe a show like this exists. I have never seen Star Wars so political before. It had politics integrated into the story as well as Battlestar Galactica. I am very satisfied with the direction of this show. 9/10 from me.nnAndor Season 2 is my most anticipated show of 2025 period.",A,09/01/2025
rw10248887,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"Was I supposed to get some campiness out of this movie? The Dastardly Dracula mustache did it for me. I thought maybe Muttley might make a guest appearance. Though this was a remake of the oldest horror film classic, there were times when I saw tributes to many other horror masterpieces such as The Exorcist and Evil Dead. Not sure if that was intended but I saw it. Overall, the story sucked (pun intended) but it was entertaining to watch another interpretation of the Dracula classic. The final laugh I had was the bone-ass, skinny legs on Dracula at the end. Reminded me of skinny legs muscle guys at the gym.

I don't know how else to describe it. It's a train wreck I can't stop watching, but the cringe is so hard I keep asking myself wtf am I watching? I would say absolutely give it a watch. But don't expect Finding Your Roots or Who Do You Think You Are? This is more like Choices, the DNA results, Canada. It seems like they are inferring they are doing some kind of research on specimens collected while it's quite obvious they are a middle man office doing business in between the lab and the lay person. I'm not sure if these are people from an actual office or just actors portraying office people. It doesn't seem to matter. The clients, when telling their stories, feel very real and at that point during the episodes it feels like it's a real ancestry show. I can't tell what generation this office is supposed to be from, but it reminds me of the 1990's, early 2000's high end art venue or spa, massage parlor maybe... It's just off. And the little off putting scenarios that aren't connected to the family stories are weird and seriously unacceptable office behavior. If you're up for a laugh and a good DNA solved family story, watch this. It's crazy wild, but somehow serious and potentially heartwarming. I dunno. It's a lot.",A,09/01/2025
rw10248867,tt34874258,Cunk on Life (2024) (TV),"This was really, really weak.nnI was fan of previous Cunk installments, but just about everything that made Cunk work was missing here.nnI always felt that the joke was that it was a comedy presented as a documentary, and a documentary presented as comedy. This is a lot dumber. Adding in self-referential ads, a sex scene, a puppet show (all incredibly unfunny) threw away any sense of documentary, so all that was left was a silly comedy.nnAnd the comedy is pretty puerile. Toilet humour that a teenage boy would find tacky abounds. Philomena is still a dim-witted ignoramus, but the laughs previously came from her being innocently earnest yet confused and out of her depth with the content she's covering. Now she's actively looking for the smutty innuendo in everything and one, it doesn't work, and two, the smutty innuendo is not clever and simply infantile.nnThe experts have always been in on the joke and their deadpan responses have always been central to the show's success. Here, it feels that they aren't being deadpan. They're in on the joke, but it seems they aren't buying the lame jokes. When Cunk asks Brian Cox, ""Am I wasting your time?"" and he responds, ""Yeah"" it doesn't feeling like a witty retort but a genuine answer.nnThe show ends lamely. Cunk makes goo-goo noises for what feels like minutes, and then she gets beamed up to space.nnDiane Morgan does as well as she can with the material, and her comedic timing and expressions are about the only positives. But the writing and tone of the show is terrible, genuine laughs are scarce and the whole thing is best avoided.",A,09/01/2025

My generation expected the story to grow up with us, when it was never really designed to. That being said, Skeleton Crew is a breath of fresh air. All of the other series that are stuck in the lore have a major problem: You know how it has to end. Skeleton Crew takes a new approach, introducing characters that have nothing g to do with Luke, Leia, Ahsoka, Anakin, Maul or Mando and is completely true to its word: Goonies meets Star Wars. And. It. Is. Amazing.",A,09/01/2025
rw10248843,tt2267998,Gone Girl (2014),This movie was super interesting especially for a film that is 2 and a half hours long. When there was 30 minutes left I thought there was still at least an hour to go. The acting by Ben Afflac was excellent the story just kept making him worse and worse until it was revealed the wife was still alive. Sadly going into the movie I already knew the twist so that wasn't as shocking to me and I knew she was alive the whole time. Still even knowing that I questioned if he did actually murder his wife. Amy was a psycho and played her role perfectly after she came home I was genuinely scared by just her facial expressions let alone her creepy dialogue. My only complaint is the ending the whole time it was setting up like her story was going to crumble beneath her but to her credit it never did. I'm not sure if it was a bad ending or just not the one I had hoped for; for example the ex boyfriend that she framed for rape could have been someone that sided with Ben Afflac story. Along with the two guys the lawyer had looking for her I thought maybe would have found something on her. Even without that I did wish the movie gave some type of resolution however it just ended. I know there isn't and won't be a second movie but it almost feels like there should be. This movie very easily could have been a 9/10 and many may argue it is. For some reason though it just didn't do it for me so I can only give it an 8. Overall good movie and highly recommended if you enjoy suspense and thrillers.,A,09/01/2025

However, I would be lying if the show didn't kind of fall apart by the end with the disappointing ending.nnMaybe if it had two more episodes, it would have been better, but there was this whole plot in the final episode that just didn't need to be there.",A,09/01/2025

I also feel foreign films will show female genital nudity every so often, unlike Hollywood which is one sided again. Miriam Mayet is beautiful in this. She was very brave with her masturbation scene and her nudity. Something you don't see biased Hollywood doing with female's, only males. Even most foreign films are biased in that way.

It depicts the ultimate sibling love between a sister with cannibalistic desires and an older brother whose body regenerates quickly. There are few anime that deal with cannibalism. While it is commendable that the company decided to go ahead with an anime adaptation, it is clear that the budget and length of the film are insufficient. Perhaps this is because they decided that it would not be profitable to spend the budget on an anime dealing with cannibalism and make it in a 12-episode structure with 24 minutes per episode. But it's better to go a little further than to have such a cheap result. What's so terrible about it? The problems are obvious. The drawings are worse than those made by a university doujinshi club.

Initially, I admit I thought it was an overrated anime, but as the episodes went on, I could see and understand why it's so successful. The way they met and the events in Akane's life were creative, and I found the beginning very interesting. It felt a bit slow in the middle (though I acknowledge that the relationship development during that time was great). However, the start of the finale was simply amazing, and I found the ending quite satisfying. The animation is simply incredible-only Madhouse could have done it. The details, like when they look at each other and a static image reminiscent of a manga panel appears, were simple but very well done. Not to mention the crying scenes, especially in episode 12, where his friend confesses everything she loves about him, and in the final scenes between the two. Those moments evoked such strong emotions in me, despite it being rare for me to feel that kind of connection. The script is one of the best I've seen for a romantic comedy. Every character behaves like normal human beings in a relationship, which is so rare, so good, and indescribable. The slow progression of the romance was simply one of the best I've ever witnessed. Additionally, portraying the story from the female protagonist's perspective was a rare and well-executed choice. The characters were excellently written, and none of the female characters were sexualized. A pure, simple, sweet, and extremely well-crafted romance.

They have been covered in other works of fiction and games, something that other reviews already detailed.nnThe way it weaves IT stuff and tech into the plot is frequent, and while isn't always correct it is doing a better job than your average hollywood movie which would get it wrong 100% of the time. Props for that. It does pile a more heavy load of multiverse concepts near the end of Season 2 that may be a bit much for viewers who have not yet had exposure to the subject matter. You will have to suspend a good amount of disbelief to prevent it from looking like a fairy tale.nnWhat the reviews with low scores overlook is that this series may very well be the first exposure of a new audience to the whole topic of transhumanism and uploading and virtual/simulated reality.nnSo to them, this IS new. That explains the 10 star ratings. And if this makes people interested in diving deeper into these topics, then that is great and perhaps the best outcome one could ever hope for.nnThere are some negatives and they kept me from checking it out sooner.nnThere is a main plot and it does have cohesion. Yet, in most episodes it feels like another writer went over the script and then thinned out the plot advances with additional emotional scenes, or by injecting a lot of anger, outrage and rude behavior that feels unnatural and out of place. Forced. Action for the sake of action.nnThe main character females in this series are often written to be abnormally hostile, pushy, empowered and douchey in a lot of scenes. While the male characters are very fond of using guns in an insane way. Both types of behavior are tolerated by other characters who then forget all about it a minute later. This is especially true for Season 1, as well as the start of Season 2. It does get significantly better after that point.nnIf you do not really care about the emotional dramatic bits you can very generously skip through them. Especially the first episodes of Season 1 have a lot of filler material that's irrelevant, so as long as you take note of the key plot developments you'll be able to follow along easily. The pace does pick up by the middle of the season.nnSeason 2 begins quite decent, and the writing gets better steadily and peaks around the second third. Towards the end there is good pacing and the story gains complexity that elevate the show. There are also less instances pointless drama, making it instead situationally appropriate, and more time is given to secondary characters who are interesting and actually enrich the plot with true variety of perspectives, without a political agenda. It is the real life situations with the cast from the first Season that often remain annoying. Skipping through them helps. The show definitely grows and explores more exotic avenues and recursive topics, with a load of philosophical themes towards the end of the second season.nnIf you can manage to hang on and watch through Season 1, you'll be rewarded with an interesting show that'll feel like it is worth your time.

The way he's written the relationship of Billy Bob Thornton and his daughter's character (who is supposed to be 17 btw) is downright disturbing. Having her run around the house in her underwear and calling him 'daddy' is just gross, along with the way she speaks to him about her sexual relationships to him is absolutely ridiculous, you will not find one father/daughter relationship like that yet his writing and directing (first 2 episodes) are just so weird and like it's his own creepy sexual fantasy. The same goes for the wife character. Just pure and utter sexualisation with next to zero substance and depth. Billy Bob and Jon Hamm carry the show because they have the talent to do so.

rw10248376,tt27470830,In Flames (2023),"I noticed In the reviews section that there were only 22 ratings from Pakistan out of the 445 or so. After watching this movie, contemplating over it and checking the cast\crew section I realized why that is so. All the writers and almost all the producers are not Pakistani aside from the main producer who is Pakistani-Canadian and the director who is also Pakistan-Canadian, and I suspect is put there by the westerners as the face of this project. A story about Pakistan forged by and portrayed through the lens of people who are effectively all non Pakistani. No wonder it came out so wrong.nnThe Film seeks to depict the challenges in a fatherless and underprivileged young girls life in Pakistan and completely misses the mark. The story and the characters are largely divorced from the ground realities of Pakistan, with its poorly written characters and a hollow storyline aside from off course the obvious attempt throughout this movie by the writers to depict Pakistani man as evil personified and the poor woman being subjected to their will as helpless, frail and abandoned by the law and culture at large. This is nothing short of what I would expect what your typical ill informed CNN and FOX watching westerner would think. From its misrepresentation of a culture, Misandry, Inconsistent and unlikeable characters, lack of depth, bad dialogues and poor choice of filming locations, this movie misses the mark by allot.nnMisandry in the Movie: The leading roles were played by women in this movie. All the males were cast in supporting roles. All of the main male characters were cast in a negatives role and a substantial amount of all the in and out male characters were also assigned a negative role. To prove this thesis I present to you examples of 7 male portrayals. 3 of the Leading male characters were depicted as; A sleazy, charmer and seducer boyfriend, An opportunist, scheming and unsympathetic uncle and A Shady Rapist rickshaw driver. 4 negative fleeting roles included; A domestic abuser father, A public masturbator, a vicious attacker (Brick thrower) and a uncooperative police official.nnThe first half of the story Involved depiction of pre marital relationships which is not common within the context of Pakistan and especially not within the context of a below middle class family as is shown here. In fact such relationships are extremely frowned upon and this could be another major reason why the film performed abysmally, because it failed to connect with the wider Pakistan audiences. When you hate on a people however subtly or otherwise and you misrepresent them in the way it is done in this movie, you should not be surprised if they don't show up and don't recommend your content to the next person.nnThe filming locations were also not attractive. Karachi has allot to offer. Could have chosen a better neighbourhood to shoot the film. Why choose a literal slum adjacent? What is this obsession of westerners with showing slums and dilapidated infrastructure in Pakistan and India?nnThere were a few critical mistranslations in the subtitles, that could have further caused the naïve viewers relying only on the translations to be appalled for no reason.. The lead character in one instance tried to say that wearing a hijab was at first a habit but as time went on became a form of worship, but it was mistranslate to the following ""First it was a habit, then became my duty"". Duty being the operative word here, suggesting that it might have been forced. Additionally when someone breaks your cars window with a damn brick, ones first instinct based on the given information would be to think that its a robbery attempt or perhaps an attempt to kill, not what is hinted at in the movie by this unlikeable white saviour indoctrinated British Pakistani character. Further there was mention of sharia by the lawyer which seemed wildly irrelevant given that the problem at hand was a flawed Pakistani judicial system not a flawed religious law as was erroneously suggested, despite the fact that the rights of the women in Islam are protected.nnAll in all this Western funded film showed Pakistan and especially Karachi in a very poor light. This film is a offense against its people.",A,08/01/2025
rw10248362,tt0805647,The Witches (2020),"""The Witches"" (2020) starring Anne Hathaway is a darkly whimsical reimagining of Roald Dahl's classic novel, but it's not without its flaws.nnHathaway's portrayal of the Grand High Witch is absolutely mesmerizing - she delivers a performance that is both wildly eccentric and chilling, embodying the villainous character with a perfect balance of humor and menace. Her dramatic physical transformation, coupled with a voice that oozes malevolence, makes her an unforgettable figure, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.nnThe film's visual design is a standout, featuring imaginative CGI that brings the world of witches to life in striking, often unsettling ways. The settings are beautifully crafted, with vibrant, exaggerated colors and dark, eerie undertones that capture the essence of Dahl's original story. While the visual effects are bold and creative, at times they veer too far into the surreal, making the experience feel more cartoonish than necessary for the darker themes the film tries to explore.nnThe story, while faithful to its source material, at times feels rushed. The pacing in some areas falters, and the transition between key moments doesn't always flow smoothly. There's an emotional disconnect in places that makes it difficult to fully engage with the characters, despite the effort from the talented cast.nnHowever, there are moments of pure magic within the film. The transformation scenes, in particular, are expertly executed, creating a sense of awe and terror. The combination of dark humor and horror, mixed with a touch of heartwarming family sentiment, provides an enjoyable experience overall.nn""The Witches"" is certainly a feast for the eyes and a joy for fans of the fantastical, but it's not quite as enchanting as it could have been. With a stronger emotional core and a more consistent pace, it could have been a true standout. Still, it's an entertaining ride, and Anne Hathaway's performance alone is worth the watch.

rw10248350,tt32526046,"""The Masked Man"" (2015)","The Masked Man (TMM) stands out as a thrilling and complex drama that delves deep into human emotions, morality, and survival in a hostile world. Spanning multiple seasons, the show combines gripping storytelling, multi-dimensional characters, and shocking twists to create a narrative that leaves a lasting impression on its audience. Its ability to balance high-stakes action with emotionally resonant moments is what makes TMM a standout show and a favorite among fans of the genre.nnAt its core, The Masked Man is a story of survival and the lengths people will go to protect themselves and their loved ones. The titular masked man serves as both a menacing antagonist and a symbol of the chaos that pervades the world of the show. From the very first season, viewers are drawn into a world where no one is safe, and every decision comes with dire consequences. This unpredictability keeps audiences on edge, making each episode a must-watch. The show's pacing is masterful, with moments of calm juxtaposed against sudden bursts of violence, creating a rhythm that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.nnThe characters are another reason why TMM is so highly regarded. The show introduces a diverse cast, each with their own unique backstories, motivations, and struggles. Characters like Jake Jarson, Penny Jarson, Sarah, Otis Mayberry, and the enigmatic masked man bring depth and complexity to the narrative. They are flawed and human, making them relatable even in their darkest moments. The show explores themes of loss, revenge, and redemption through these characters, allowing audiences to connect with their journeys on a personal level. For instance, Jake's transformation from a protective father figure to a man broken by tragedy is both heartbreaking and compelling, while Penny's resilience in the face of unimaginable loss inspires hope amidst the darkness.nnOne of TMM's strengths lies in its ability to craft memorable and emotionally impactful moments. From shocking deaths like Sidney's in Season 4, Episode 13, to powerful confrontations between characters, the show consistently delivers scenes that linger in the minds of viewers. These moments are often accompanied by expertly crafted dialogue, such as Sarah's iconic line, ""Try me, bitch,"" which showcases the characters' strength and defiance in the face of danger. The writers' willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of traditional storytelling elevates TMM above other shows in the genre.nnThe show's ability to blend different tones and genres also contributes to its appeal. While primarily a survival drama, TMM incorporates elements of horror, mystery, and even moments of dark humor. The masked man himself is a terrifying figure, embodying the fear of the unknown, but the show also delves into the psychological toll of living in a world plagued by violence and betrayal. This combination of external and internal conflicts adds depth to the story, making it more than just a series about survival.nnVisually, TMM is stunning, with its use of atmospheric settings and cinematography enhancing the mood of the show. The forest sequences, abandoned towns, and tense nighttime confrontations create a sense of isolation and dread that perfectly complements the narrative. The show's attention to detail, from the design of the masked man's costume to the realistic portrayal of injuries and struggles, adds to its authenticity and immersive quality.nnDespite occasional dips in quality, such as the slower pacing in parts of Season 5, The Masked Man remains a strong and compelling series overall. It has moments of brilliance that showcase its ability to surprise, scare, and move its audience. Its strongest episodes, like ""Try Me,"" ""What It's Like Without Him,"" and ""The End?,"" demonstrate the show's emotional and narrative prowess.nnIn conclusion, The Masked Man is a good show because it combines gripping storytelling, complex characters, emotional depth, and intense action to create an unforgettable viewing experience. It challenges its audience to confront their own notions of morality and survival while delivering a thrilling and emotionally charged narrative. It is a testament to the power of great storytelling and remains a standout series in its genre.",A,08/01/2025
rw10248348,tt24176060,Queer (2024/I),"Tonight I watched Queer in cinema as part of a monthly Pride Evening. The movie theatre was loaded. I didn't know anything about the movie, except that Daniel Graig was the lead in a gay character. To be honest it was not an easy watch. Daniel's alcohol and drug use is enormous. He looks dishevelled, his fingers and nails brown from smoking. The silent young man he falls in love with is truly gorgeous and athletic.

rw10248319,tt1630029,Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"I thought Avatar 1 was the best sci fi adventure-epic since the original Star Wars trilogy, but Avatar 2 was at best somewhat vaguely interesting. I was hoping for an Empire Strikes Back experience -- an original, thrilling sequel with the same epic storyline, music, and visual effects as the first film in the series. Instead, I was massively, epically disappointed. Avatar 2 features a completely forgettable soundtrack, as James Horner died after making the music for Avatar 1. The film is 3 hours long, and while the first half is intriguing, the second half is lackluster, and the final act is dull and repetitive, with some major plot events copied almost verbatim from the first film. The story effectively expands the lore of the Avatar universe by focusing on Jakes children and the reincarnated Colonel, which I thought was cool, but not sufficient to redeem the movie completely. The visual effects are as groundbreaking as Avatar 1, but without a soundtrack and story to go along with it the movie falls flat. Only diehard fans of Avatar 1 will appreciate this movie. The bottom line is that with all the resources James Cameron has access to, this should have been a much better sequel, especially after so many of us waited for it for 13 years.",A,08/01/2025

rw10248287,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"I will admit, I have not seen F. W. Murnau's 1922 ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror"" or Werner Herzog's 1979 ""Nosferatu the Vampyre,"" but I've watched a few youtube videos, so that obviously give me plenty of ethos here. Robert Eggers is one of my favorite current directors, for someone with a catalogue of 3 films prior to this, he is an absolutely baffling talent who puts so much artistic drive and direction into every film. It's no surprise that such a prolific master of so many different kinds of horror would go on to tackle his life-long dream of adapting Nosferatu this early on into his career, and I am absolutely here for it.nnEggers' adaptation of Nosferatu is probably the most visually stunning horror film to come out in 2024. The gothic architecture, the night scenes that somehow manage to be nearly daylight bright, but also pitch dark at the same time, and let's not forget what I think is the second most impactful shot in the film, Count Orlok's gnarled, ugly, decrepit hand stretched out as far as the eye can see over Wisborg as pained screams from the victims of his plague echo hauntingly.nnNearly every performance on display here is one for the history books, in my humble opinion. Aaron-Taylor Johnson as Friedrich Harding is an absolute dick and Emma Corrin as Anna Harding is a true friend to Ellen (I also got major queer vibes from her and Ellen in the scene before Orlok comes to her at the window, that may just be me). Simon McBurney as Herr Knock is absolutely insane, he fell straight into this psychotic role, Willem Dafoe as Albin Eberhart von Franz is definitely NOT Van Helsing, but what he is is an absolutely obsessed genius who will go every length to stop Orlok, there's nothing i can say about Dafoe that hasn't already been said a billion times. And of course, who can forget our main trio of absolutely stellar performances? Nicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter, our sweet, loyal, naive every man through whom we see the true, abject horror of Count Orlok, Lily-Rose Depp proves that good acting does run in the family as she plays the tortured, noble heroine Ellen Hutter, haunted from a young age by a purely evil darkness because of circumstances she did not deserve, who makes the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film to save the people of Wisborg. Depp certainly has the strongest emotional performance, you can really see her absolute torment as she hopes like hell to escape Orlok's grasp and the sheer conflict in her as she makes the ultimate act of true love to save her dear Thomas from the absolute monster that is Count Orlok. And of course, how could I possibly forget, Bill Skarsgård as the absolutely pure evil villain that is count Orlok, putting on the strongest overall performance. Seriously, if you told me that was Bill Skarsgård and I didn't already know, i would call you a liar. Orlok's booming, deep, raspy voice strikes fear into all who hear it (the addition of him only breathing to speak magnifies the fear factor by a solid 1000%), he truly falls deep into a role of pure horror, an villain with absolutely no comprehension of the word ""mercy.""nnHowever, for as stunning as the performances are (which elevate some admittedly static characters to a much higher quality), I believe the biggest thing that makes this movie an instant classic, setting it apart from its contemporaries, is the heightened sexuality of it all. The way that Orlok preys on Ellen in the original, the way that he feeds, everything about the original film is inherently sexual, so the decision from Eggers to bring that sexual to a higher, more explicit forefront was an absolutely brilliant idea. Going into the film, i knew that there was some sexual content in it, but i had no idea how dripping with sexuality this movie would be. The way that Orlok drains blood from Thomas at the beginning of the film feels almost like an act of fellatio, straddled on top of him and drinking the blood from him with absolutely disgusting and appalling gulps feels like an act of violation. And of course, the central conflict of the movie, Orlok's pure, carnal desire for Ellen Hutter, is just as gross as it sounds. Ellen and Thomas having rough, aggressive sex while she calls out to Orlok in an act of hopeless defiance against him, and of course, the way that Orlok sleeps with her at the end of the film is strangely beautiful in a purely disgusting way. The final shot of the film, Orlok's withered corpse of a body laying dead atop Ellen, wreathed in flowers as the early morning sun pours in through the windows, is a hauntingly gorgeous shot. It was absolutely uncomfortable to watch and i loved every second of it. The exploration of Ellen's sexual shame, manifested as Count Orlok, and the way that said shame kills her in the end, is a tale as old as time, but one that is explored beautifully in this film.nnOverall, Nosferatu is a dramatic, gorgeous, disgusting, sexual tragedy of a film, and one that i think fits very well into Eggers' filmography. I wouldn't say that it's better than the Lighthouse, as that film is more cinematically beautiful, thematically unique, and superiorly performed, Nosferatu still falls in place as one of the best horror films of the 2020s thus far and certainly as one of the best adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",A,08/01/2025

On the paper, it's truly the dream for a fan, but the reality is the total opposite. It's just a +4hrs non-stop interviews of the 60% of the cast, who speak about things we already know or are already well-known, there is no off-voice to explain anything, you just deal with screen changing and interviews with sample of the movie and sometimes a rare making of footage.nn- They didn't pay any tribute to Trevor Steedman and barely spoke about Tip Tipping, no tribute to Paul Maxwelln- No tribute to Jay Benedict too, I didn't recall it was even mentioned in this ""doc""n- Very small tribute to Al Matthews, the same for James Horner (they overshadow his difficult work and didn't mention that he used old stuff like Star Trek sample for Aliens OST)n- There is no interview of the cast of the director's cut such as Christopher Henn, Mac McDonald and Holly de Jong.nn- There is no interview of the small cast such as Barbara Coles (they even didn't know that her name is Mary, they refer to her as the cocooned colonist...), Valerie Colgan, Alibe Parsons, Alan Polonsky or even Carl Toop and Eddie Powell (who were inside the xenemorph costumes)n- Do you know the name of the guy who pull out his mask on the very first scene and say the first ""real"" sentence?

rw10248200,tt27896931,"""The Curious Case of Natalia Grace"" (2023)","The Curious Case of Natalia Grace had the potential to be a thoughtful exploration of a unique and tragic story, but instead, it devolves into a sensationalized and manipulative spectacle. What could have been a balanced and respectful documentary instead relies heavily on dramatization, questionable editing, and forced narrative twists.nnFrom the beginning, the series locks viewers into a false dichotomy: either Natalia was an innocent six-year-old child or a sociopathic adult pretending to be one. Both extremes lack nuance, and the truth, as the series suggests, likely lies somewhere in the middle. However, instead of exploring this complexity, the show leans on overblown claims and fabricated suspense.nnScenes that should be raw and spontaneous, like Natalia's emotional reaction to seeing a childhood photo or her interactions with key figures from her past, are marred by overly edited sequences. Multiple angles and dramatic cuts make it clear that these moments have been staged, turning reality into a poorly constructed drama. This approach not only undermines the credibility of the series but also strips away the humanity of Natalia herself, reducing her to a character in a fictionalized narrative.nnLater seasons spiral further into sensationalism, introducing dramatic shifts in how Natalia's second adoptive family is portrayed. Initially depicted as loving and supportive, they are later accused of exploitation and abuse with little substantiated evidence. These forced narrative twists feel contrived, designed only to keep viewers engaged rather than to honor the complexity of the case.nnEven more troubling is how the creators try to emulate groundbreaking documentaries like The Jinx. Manufactured moments-such as dramatic phone calls conveniently received during production-attempt to replicate the impact of real revelations but lack the authenticity that made those moments in The Jinx memorable.nnWhat is most disappointing, however, is the exploitation of Natalia herself. After enduring years of hardship, she is now subjected to further manipulation by being portrayed as a volatile character whose story shifts to suit the producers' needs. This is not a documentary about understanding the truth-it's about stretching a narrative for as many seasons and viewers as possible.",A,08/01/2025
rw10248159,tt34874258,Cunk on Life (2024) (TV),"The latest entry in Charlie Brooker's Cunk On... universe, Cunk on Life is certainly not Diane Morgan's funniest outing as the fantastically oblivious documentarian Philomena Cunk, but she retains all the brainless charm we would want. As usual, she offers up her own understanding of the subjects in-between a series of interviews where we yet again must ask just how ""in on it"" the interviewees were.nnThis time around, she explores life itself and the many different explanations for how life exists, not to mention the greatest of all questions: why.nnIt doesn't take too long before she starts interviewing those who believe that the greatest riddle of all time isn't actually a riddle at all (and yet will project arrogance onto those who simply try to explain that NOBODY truly knows the answer and/or ask that people would PROVE these things before taking them as definitively factual), namely the religious. The first exchange with ""spiritual author"" and parapsychology scholar Rupert Sheldrake perfectly distills what I'm referring to: ""Is there a God?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh, that was quick.""nnLater, Cunk tries to wrap her head around science, death, the philosophies that concern death, and the role that science seems to have assumed following the proverbial death of God, but more and more of the jokes end up rather lame. Cunk on Life is not as consistently or constantly hilarious as 2023's Cunk on Earth, and some of the less successful gags are in the form of skits, an element that Cunk on Earth did not use. It's also markedly more juvenile than before. The best parts are still the narrations and interviews, which make perfect use of the bewildering stupidity of this character.nnWhen people say she's Borat-ing, they don't just mean the simple fact that she's doing a docu-comedy where a character interacts with real people who do not know that it is a character. Just as Borat speaks with people who are racist enough to believe that a caricature like Borat could be a real person (validating them to a point where they reveal even uglier things about themselves), Cunk often seems to come across scholars who are sufficiently full of themselves to believe that Cunk/Diane Morgan really is just that dumb (not discerning that they're the ones being taken for a ride).",A,08/01/2025

rw10248117,tt0264508,Dagon (2001),"I watched Dagon (2001) without any big expectations, driven by the curiosity of recently visiting Combarro, the coastal village where it was filmed. Honestly, I was expecting a weak production, maybe even something trashy and amateur, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. Despite some flaws, especially the visual effects that aged very poorly, Dagon turned out to be an engaging experience, particularly for fans of Lovecraftian horror.nnThe story follows a group of tourists who, after a storm damages their yacht, end up stranded in a village called Imboca. From the very beginning, the atmosphere is dark and unsettling, with the villagers exuding a disturbing and eerie vibe. While the narrative doesn't break new ground, it keeps you hooked with its constant tension and air of mystery. The characterization of the villagers is especially creepy and bizarre, reminding me of the Ganados from Resident Evil 4. I wouldn't be surprised if the creators of the game drew inspiration from this film, given the visual similarities and the unsettling nature of the Imboca inhabitants.nnOne of Dagon's greatest strengths is its atmosphere. It's the kind of movie best enjoyed on a stormy night, with the darkness and the sound of the wind enhancing the experience. The suspense is well-crafted and, in that regard, surpasses many more recent horror films. Although it's not consistently violent, the moments of gore are strikingly effective. One scene, in particular, stuck with me: near the end, there's a character being skinned alive in a graphic and brutal sequence, rivaling some of the more shocking moments from the Terrifier series.nnHowever, not everything works perfectly. The film's biggest drawback is its visual effects, which suffer from the limited budget and outdated technology. Some scenes that could have been truly memorable lose their impact due to these technical shortcomings. In my opinion, this movie deserves a remaster with updated effects or even a reboot that preserves its weirdness and darker elements.nnI'm honestly thankful I didn't watch this movie as a child, as I'm sure I would've been both terrified and traumatized by the villagers' grotesque appearances and the violent scene near the end. It's a curious and flawed film, but one that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone who enjoys solid horror with a touch of mystery.",A,08/01/2025

Early team games force impossible choices: strive for glory or sacrifice yourself for the group, individual ambition versus collective survival. Beneath its highnbudget production, it's Jr. Squid Game show, how the wealthy exploit the struggles of the less fortunate for entertainment. Despite its intensity, it struggles to find originality.nnI particularly hate the 2nd event, where people in a line need to self scarifies themselves to save the group and for that group to advance.

Instead of embracing the raw, visceral authenticity that made the earlier films iconic, the over-polished, obviously computer-generated visuals dilute the impact. With an entire continent at their disposal for filming, it's baffling that they chose artificial backdrops over real landscapes.

These three actors did a marvelous job as one would expect, with a roster of other Hollywood A-listers being basically underutilized to tragic effect.nnSharing the big screen with his co-star Gleeson from 28 Days Later, Cillian Murphy gets a surprisingly small amount of screentime as Mr Joy, 1st mate Chase's closest friend. Cillian Freaking Murphy with surprisingly little time in front of a camera! Adjacent his legendary talent is co-star Paul Anderson of Peaky Blinders with only a few lines of dialogue in the movie.

I hear you ask.nnOverall, its not representative of Tolkien's writing and I find that too jarring to get over. Examples:nThe Orcs are presented as a somewhat misunderstood race, but they are evil creatures created by corruption.nnGaladriel at this point in the books has a husband and child, but no acknowledgement of that and her character is not someone that has been through thousands of years, from the age of the trees to the second age, she behaves like a 20-something year old.nnSauron (yes, its obvious) is one of the Maiar, but Galadriel (on her ridiculous hunt for) doesn't recognise that and just sees him as human, behave.nnThe Harfoots and Dwarves alike, I find buffoonish, and that annoys me - they're meant to be a race of people (well, the dwarves are) and they are just a caricature.nnWith all the free roam for the second age and they created something that in reality challenges canon. A lot of people will say so what, but the problem with that isnthat we will never get a Silmarillion adaptation, which would have been brilliant to see in cinema as a TWO part film.nnI gave it 4 stars because some of the visuals, especially Numenor, did look amazing.nnNot the costumes though, they looked quite cheap, can't believe the budget was more than Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the Rings (only - not the Hobbit films - they also looked terrible).",A,08/01/2025

I think it's because the explanation or excuse that she gives to Ella does not make sense. She blames Ella for everything and claims that she always had a choice when we have seen with our own eyes that this is not the case. Nothing happens to this fairy and I think she just flies off- she doesn't even get her dress dirty.

But no, he watches fully clothed women on websites yet thinks he's watching porn, he is obviously meant to be turned on by this, yet never thinks of touching himself. He is picked on by the stereotype jock bullies, who think he's a freak because one time he looked at yet more fully dressed people but this time wearing rubber/latex.

rw10247783,tt0099864,"""It"" (1990)","The books I loved as a child were Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""House on the Prairie"" series. I read every single one. I cried when her dog Jack died, and I shivered along with her in the middle of summer during the winter of blizzards on the prairie. I also liked Anne of Green Gables, but there was something about the pioneers that set them apart. The next year I read the entire Narnia series. The year after that I read The Hobbit. I spent more time reading than watching tv as a kid, but I did manage to stumble onto a few horror movies during the free HBO week or month we would get occasionally.nn""It"" was not among the free HBO horror flicks. I only happened to watch this one bc my friend Irene invited us over for a slumber party in the summer of 1990. She must have taped the series when it aired on tv that year. (Hopefully, this aired before the summer, bc otherwise it would count as part of the pirated collection.) This Pennywise was the creepiest? I did have honest nightmares for a few nights after the slumber party, but I didn't really think much more about the killer clown. Clowns aren't that common.nnNot until 2019 did I make connection to my actual life. I happened to see an ad for the latest ""It"" release back in 2017 when it aired on tv in 2019. I set my DVR and watched the movie, but this one wasn't as scary as that one in 1990. There was something scarier about the pre-internet pre-cellular world. I read the wikipedia summary for the movie. I counted the interval between the years I first saw a clown at a school, my 1983 kindergarten graduation ceremony, and the year I saw a clown in a local library, the 2010 Oak Lodge Library clown. They were the exact number of years apart as specified in the book! What? I wasn't a believer until the numbers added up.nnMagically, that October 2019 a person impersonating a woman who was impersonating my brother walked up behind me at a local Wendy's (Cin-Dayton Rd.) and made a very insulting gesture. He was with a woman who looked like someone I ate lunch with my junior year of high school at Lakota. I didn't know that group that well. I just happened to eat lunch with them. Anyways, I think he was a very bad man whoever he was? It didn't help that the Wendy's staff told me that I almost got ""it"" that day if that man hadn't done that behind my back in line. The clerk with the beard told me that she was a ""witch."" He was shaking his head yes. She's a witch. He had dark hair and was heavyset just like my brother. He was sick. Did I see ""it"" or did I see someone trying to save me from hitmen at Wendy's? Either way, I apologized on his behalf bc I was afraid of a race war.nnAll of that was much scarier than the1990 ""It"" series. The basic premise of ""It"" is that a little boy dies in a sewer. Supposedly, this Pennywise rips off the little boy's arm while he's chasing a paper boat that floats away down the sewer drain. Now, if my brother had died in similar circumstances then I would have been much more negatively affected by the fictional account.nnMy brain never picked up on the clues bc my brain always made Mark the same person. My brain absolutely can tell the difference between identical twins and most doppelgängers, but I couldn't tell that someone wasn't there anymore. Denial? My brain not exploding? Someone standing behind my back in 2020-2021 was pointing to a local toy store, but I don't know what happened there in the 1980s. In my multiverse, we visited only one time and my mother was complaining about the prices. We didn't buy anything and left. That's all I remember from the 1980s. If my brother was sent back to Pittsburgh, it was bc my father must have found out that he wasn't his biological son.nnIn February 2020, I found out that I had been kidnapped in the city of Pittsburgh, PA in either 1978 or 1979 at the age of 18 months. After 10 DNA tests at five different companies I am no closer to finding out the identity of my ethnicity or biological parents as they were before the test. The DNA companies published fake DNA relatives for me bc someone told them that my father was an overseas asset. I won't ever know the truth. The two options were a cousin who was French/Slovenian who was from the same neighborhood as my mother or a woman who was part Turkish and part French or Norwegian or Finnish. No one in my family had ever met her. It sounds like she committed suicide in 1978 due to the ballet troupe, and the kidnapper kidnapped me from a babysitter's thinking I was his. The only thing Todd ever said to me was that I looked like the matron of a girls boarding school.nnIt sounds like the young lady who lived in the Boston area in the 1990s could have had the same biological mother? We did look alike in the photos. We never met. Is it possible that her Dad was French Dad with the wider set eyes, and my Dad was the Italian Swiss Turkish man from Istanbul? She was trying to find Oz, but she never met him. Anyways, there was something disturbing about that British movie, ""My Beautiful Launderette."" I just saw that one last year. I have to caution that it could have been that two Turkish woman looked alike?nnPennywise wasn't as scary after all that and the pandemic. To this date, I haven't actually ever seen a dead body, except for the times at University Hospital Cincinnati between 2000-2002 when I would be working near a window and they would wheel a draped body to the morgue across the hall.nn**** I am NOT the cat from Fairfield. My only sexual partner was an old man who used the name of Michael who lived at 4692 SE Derry Lane Milwaukie, OR 97267 between 2007-2010. I haven't seen him since 2010.

His behavior was so loving. He was a cat who acted like a dog. He was declawed. Everybody loved this cat. He was cuddled up next to me,'' Finn said.nn""On Christmas day it was really bothering me. This cat let my 3-year-old carry him around like he was a stuffed animal - he tolerated it. I said 'I know this cat has kids.' It was so heavy on my heart.""nSo she spent two hours combing through missing cat posts until she found a listing about a cat with unique markings that matched those of the cat her family was caring for.nn""Once that happened...I reached out to her (McClain), wrote a long message. I woke up on Dec. 26 and had all these messages from her.""nThe two women and their children met in a downtown Cincinnati parking lot to verify it was the right cat and then return Leo.nnThat's when both families unraveled the mystery of how Leo ended up in with the Johnston-Finn home.nnAfter getting out of the family's garage unbeknownst to the McClains as they were leaving for work and school, Leo made his way to the Jeff Wyler Honda dealership on Colerain Avenue - a distance of six miles - where Paul Finn was a salesman.nnAfter two days of the cat - then dirty and emaciated - trying to get inside the dealership or sleeping under cars, Paul Finn took it home to Fort Mitchell. The family already had two cats, a dog, and a button quail.nnEveryday Johnston combed Facebook postings trying to find out who Leo belonged to as he was becoming a part of their family - loved by her 3- and 6-year-old sons, Rory and Knox.nn""My kids were heartbroken - absolutely devastated - when we thought we found the owners,"" Johnston said.nn""But we kept reminding them if it were their cat would they want somebody to keep it. Doing the right thing even when you know doing the wrong thing has no consequences is the right thing to do.""nThe two moms didn't tell their children in advance that Leo might be returning to him home when they met in the parking lot of the Frisch's near the Cincinnati Museum Center.nn""I felt sad when I lost him,"" Addy said.

rw10247761,tt0075323,"That's Entertainment, Part II (1976)","Turner Classic Movies did fans of musicals a huge favor on New Year's Day this year when they ran ""That's Entertainment"" numbers I, II, and III in succession. For this second entry however, I'm in agreement with a whole host of reviewers here on IMDb who feel that this one wasn't as focused as the first release from 1974. Whereas the original was entirely committed to MGM musicals from roughly 1929 through much of the Fifties, this one thought it would be a good idea to insert drama and comedy clips among the musical sequences, and it just came off as a random collection of clips with no relationship to each other. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire share hosting duties and even at their advanced age (Astaire 77, Kelly 63), manage to tap and dance their way through a few intricate numbers. A neat highlight was a scene from ""It's Always Fair Weather"" from 1955 in which Kelly does an entire sequence on roller skates. Although a number of comedians are billed for this program, you'll miss Laurel and Hardy and W. C. Fields in still shots if you blink, however there's an Abbott and Costello routine involving earplugs I'd never seen before. Marx Brothers fans will thoroughly enjoy the stateroom scene from ""A Night at the Opera"", enough so you'll want to catch the whole picture. Judy Garland shows up a lot in scenes with Astaire and Kelly, again, randomly placed, while a retrospective of films featuring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn takes up a fair amount of screen time. If you're not familiar with their careers, a few scenes will surprise, with folks like Frank Sinatra and Greta Garbo shown dancing, and a couple of Roberts, that would be Montgomery and Taylor, actually singing. Not very well, but that's what MGM pushed some of their stars to do while under contract. One downside, and it happened frequently enough in both I and II, is that some of the movie clips aren't identified by title, so if you wanted to check them out, it would be difficult to do. For example, my summary line above didn't even mention who said it and where; it was Franchot Tone speaking to Jean Harlow in the 1933 film ""Bombshell"". The full quote, if I may, was actually ""Your hair is like a field of silver daisies. I'd like to run barefoot through your hair"".",A,08/01/2025

This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort.

rw10247618,tt1632701,"""Suits"" (2011)","Suits is an haighly praised, high-drama legal series with flat characters, it's not without its flaws. Here's why I'm giving it 3 starsnn1. Donna - She's the reason I stuck with the show through Season 5. Donna is incredibly skilled, witty, and sharp, and while she has no boundaries and doesn't always respect others', she's undeniably a force to be reckoned with. Her strength and charisma make her an unforgettable character, and her presence on screen elevates the entire series.nn2. Jessica - A refreshing contrast in a sea of cis straight white male characters, Jessica brings power and elegance to the table. Her performance is top-notch, and her role as a formidable boss is both empowering and captivating. She adds a layer of depth and complexity that makes her a standout amidst the chaos. And Gina Torres was great for the roll.nn3. Drama - If you're in the mood for something that doesn't require too much thought, Suits delivers. The drama is engaging, perfect for zoning out or letting it run in the background. The show's characters are easy to recognize by both voice and actions, and it's simple to pick up if you missed a bit of the plot, they'll explain things again.nnConsnnThat being said, there are some significant drawbacks that really affected my enjoyment:nnThe show often feels like a glorification of toxic masculinity. The men are consistently portrayed as self-centered, boundary-pushing individuals with little to no regard for others. They manipulate the system, defend morally questionable CEOs, and bend the law for the rich and powerful. Unfortunately, the characters don't grow or evolve; if anything, they become worse versions of themselves as the series progresses.nnThe characters rarely face any real consequences for their actions. This lack of accountability for the behavior of these entitled, often insufferable men becomes frustrating, especially when their bad actions are constantly praised by both the show's characters and its fanbase. The portrayal of these rich, arrogant figures left me feeling disillusioned, and honestly, it soured my view of the show.nnSuits can be incredibly engaging, but its depiction of toxic dynamics and the unrelenting praise of morally gray characters left me disenchanted. By the end, I couldn't help but feel like the show had inadvertently reinforced a lot of harmful stereotypes. The men in this show turned me gay for women. And Rachel made question if I was indeed gay for women.nnDespite the strong performances and clever writing, the lack of character growth and the show's problematic themes ultimately left me with mixed feelings.",A,08/01/2025

Nope, but for a romfan it will pass the time very nicely. I'll stick some toes over the edge of the cliff & say it's worth watching for Song Ha Yoon's performance alone. She EATS her role up. PMY is always worth watching. NIW isn't bad to look at, either.nnThis drama is actually an advice column. There's plenty of useful truths to be gleaned, such as:nn👠Shoes your friends wisely - eh, 'Choose,' I mean.nn👠We accept the love we think we deserve (from The Perks Of Being A Wallflower).nn👠Keep your friends close & your enemies closer (until the battle is over)nn👠Statements don't grow up to be cliches b/c they're mostly false.nn👠Some people just get used to losing. Some losers don't realize what (big picture) losers they are & will do anything to avoid (small picture) losing. Losing once in awhile is not a bad thing, as pride is always the biggest problem. Humility is good for the soul. Being a doormat, though, will rob your life's essence.nnOuch. Ep1 HURTS. Kang ""Ji"" Won has led a painful life & now she's close to death: Stage 4 cancer. ""I never knew happiness,"" she says. Horrible husband. Horrible family. Horrible friends. Her husband & bff cause her death & now they will enjoy the life insurance payout. The End.nnBut wait! There's more! After the end, Ji gets a reset. She wakes up back in time, year 2013... Meltdown! Is this a dream? If so, is 2023 the dream or 2013.2? Let the Chippies fall where they may... & Ji has a couple snagging Chippies in her life.nnTo go along w/ MMH one has to be accepting, as there's no acceptable reasoning for the time slip. It's connected to the FL's father, but that's all we know. Our FL learns that fated consequences are FATED and must occur. In her prior life she had a crescent-shaped scar on her arm from a coffee pot burn. She manages to avoid getting burned the 2nd time, but, instead, our ML gets burned w/ a scar /exactly/ like Ji's. Therefore, she proceeds slowly. Methodically. Carefully. She won't break up w/ her bf & future killer until she's certain she's transferred her bad fate w/ him onto her frenemy/her killer's aider-and-abetter, her lifetime friend, Soo-Min. They lay down a satisfactory (enough) premise.nnIt's also illogical at times. It's constructed in a way that's easy to ride along with as everything is attributable to fate. Fates can be transferred to others, but not avoided. They use physical objects, like shoes & candy, to reset the scene & channel ill fates to those who deserve it. After a person opens a door s/he never would/should have in ep15, & allows another party to barge in - it just wouldn't happen - I then had to stop, reflect, & admit that the whole show is built on an arguably silly premise. But I'd been enjoying it w/o a care-to-logic until then, which is indicative of skill & good execution. Just take the ride & don't think too much. If you can do that, the show is good.nnOtikay?nnIt's 2013. Again. What does Ji do?nn🍬Break up w/ the jerk.nn🍬Buy stocks.nn🍬Stop being a doormat.nnBeing a doormat is not an easy habit to quit, though. Ji gets help. She's made new friends at work & she, unbeknownst to her, has an angel watching over her. 19 hours of programming gives the show ample time to methodically stroll through the plot. It takes our leads awhile to pair up. They have legitimate concerns: The prior timeline was brutal to Ji. After the break-up, the coffee pot/scar incident occurs, so she decides to soften her stance on her status w/ ex, Min Hwan - just until she leverages the potential outcome.nnPark Min Young, a truly special talent, is the FL, Kang ""Ji"" Won. I've seen her in What's Wrong with Secretary Kim-6.8 (apologies, it's cute, but overrated IMHO) Forecasting Love & Weather-6.8, When the Weather Is Fine-9 (it's brilliant) & Her Private Life-8 (This one deserves the accolades that Sec-Kim gets. It's adorabs)nnNa In Woo (Spark-6.4) plays Yoo Ji Hyuk. He's a tad geeky & wears ill fitting suits that look like tents. That's by design, as his character gets a needed upgrade after exposure to our FL. Purely observationally, this actor looks like a giant next to the ladies, & he also has the largest Adam's apple I've ever seen. He's an impressive looking man.nnLee Yi Kyung (Eulachacha Waikiki) portrays the weasel bf, Park Min Hwan. Song Ha Yoon (Intimate Strangers) portrays Jung Soo Min, Ji""s frenemy, & she does It marvelously. The character is yicky-icky, but the actress has a tough job, acting as a near split-personality who does drama better than ElizabethTaylor, & she sticks the landing. In fact, by ep10, I was most impressed w/ her: She's amazing. Other than guest appearances, Choi Gyu-Ri's only other role is in Behind Every Star. In MMH she plays Ji's new work friend, Yoo Hee-Yeon & she's darling. I hope to see more of her. Director, Park Won Gook also brought us Special Labor Inspector Jo, & Screenwriter Shin Yoo Dam wrote the high IQ show, Awaken. The worst criticism of MMH is that it's boilerplate stuff, but the execution is above average. It also has worthy themes.nn1st of all, some people don't know when to stop. ""Gosh, I can just never win against you!"", exclaims 1 conniving mean girl after losing at chess. ""Well, I could predict your moves b/c you tried to take it all,"" is the reply. ""A good leader should know how to let go of what is not theirs,"" is the follow-up pearl of wisdom.nn2ndly, messed up parents leave a massive pile of refuse on top of their kids' heads. I'm not trying to beat up on anyone. I doubt there is such a thing as parenting w/ zero regrets. The perfect parent has yet to be discovered. We need to try & keep the baggage to a minimum & the 💘 at a maximum. Many kids can't dig out from underneath the mess & go through life at a disadvantage. Ji's mother ran off with another man - in a town so small everyone knows how many 'spoons are in each house'. The vicious gossip piled pressure on Ji to not be like her Oma. She has to look perfect. Act perfect. Cast no shadows. That's why she accepted the love she could ""get"". She accepted the scraps that Soo Min & Min Hwan threw at her. There was no real love there. They only used her to bolster their own egos. She was a disposable ladder for them.nn3rdly, we have another theme that is 1 of the harshest & cruelest truths that I know: Weakness is not OK. Weakness invites aggression, & enables evil: In the end, it's not much different than evil. It's easy to have compassion for somebody who's in a weak state, & we're all liable to be weakened at 1 point or another. That's just part of being human. Perhaps people who are weak enjoy the compassion & the attention tossed their way. But, in the long run, it's only going to allow in a bunch of trash. Evil must be opposed. It's like weeds. If you don't stamp them out they'll take over. I know this is brutal, but it happens to be 100% true. Sometimes, running away is the best opposition, sometimes fighting back is. Lying around to be someone else's doormat is never the right course. Never, ever, ever, EVER. And: Wallowing in self-pity is not only pathetic, it's contemptible.nnThe writer dropped more pearls of wisdom for us. Min Hwan is jealous of the boss b/c of the way Ji's been looking at him & visa-versa. He pulls her aside & unwittingly lets his character show: MH: "" I told you that jerk likes you."" JW: ""He has a girlfriend."" MH: ""You are so naive. Do you really think that matters to a guy? Do you know what? Every single man is a cheater. So he has a girlfriend? A guy could be married & still like someone else. You know what a man's dream girl is? An unfamiliar lady that he doesn't know yet. That's just how men are..."" By the time Ji has this following exchange with Soo-Min she's grown significantly: S: ""Why do you hate me?"" J: ""You're self-centered. Some people have a way of eroding those around them, & you are exactly that type of person...You don't trust easily. And it's only b/c you can't be trusted. You think that everyone is like you, & so you can't trust them."" When people tell you who they are, please believe them & protect yourself accordingly. Protect yourself, don't /project/ yourself.nnActing ✔. Writing ✔. Directing ✔ - all are good. The artistry is also smashing. The wardrobe is outstanding. Both of our leads dress in DRAB, until they decide to do better - to BE better. Then they go from drab to fab. ""People are already treating me differently b/c of my outfit."" Ji just gave herself a makeover. She's experiencing 1st-hand how important appearances are in public life. It may not be right, but it is so. Turns out, once Ji Hyuk's in a suit that fits right, all the ladies in the office are checking him out, too. By the beginning of ep6 they look like a matched Ken & Barbie in ⚫ & ⚪ chic. There's a gorgeous wedding dress in one ep. The music is quite good, too, such as The Journey, by Kelley McRae & Wounds of Time, by Kim So Yeon. Half of ep 16 is a well executed wrap-up - what has been lacking from too many Kdramas in the past. As long as you enjoy Kromcoms, this one has its savory appeal.nnIn parting, I'll quote one k!ck@$$, self-actualized woman, Sarah Connor: ""There is no fate but what we make."" 〰From The Terminator movies〰nnQUOTE📢nnThe mother of success is failure.nnYou're right.

rw10247565,tt13147708,RWBY: Volume 7 (2020) (V),"RWBY has been an amazing journey so far, from its classic beginnings (Seasons 1-3), through to the mixed received middle era (Seasons 4-6). Now, I have reached the final seasons... well as of yet, many are still to come. From what I am able to gather, 7-9 seems to be the least talked about era compared to the others, and I'm not quite sure the reason.nnThe only explanation I could maybe come up with is that people either find these last few seasons forgettable, or that there's not so much to talk about... but man do I have a lot to talk about when it comes to Volume 7. Seeing as I knew I was reaching RWBY's 3rd era, I wasn't sure what to expect.nnI barley have found many reviews when it comes to Volume 7, let alone many people even talking about it in general. In fact, as unpopular Volumes 8-9 are to the fandom, they're at least talked about for a variety of different reasons, whereas Volume 7 sort of just... exists. And after giving it a watch... I have to say that this is probably the definitive example of the term ""slow burn"".nnQuickly, I must get one thing out of the way which is somewhat upsetting... this is probably the worst soundtrack in RWBY... and yet its still incredible! By no means is it anywhere near the level of Volume 4 or 1's soundtrack, but it's so worth the listen. The first half of the lyrical songs are very... strange, and are mainly jazz-like or upbeat music you wouldn't expect from something as angry and metal as RWBY.nnWith that said, the second half carries a lot of that Volume 6 energy, where everything feels so passive aggressive, where all the characters are tired of playing games! It stands out the most in fight scenes as well, I couldn't help but notice the strange shift in instruments and tone in the second half of the soundtrack compared to the first...nnAnd that's the best way I can explain its volume... having a pretty standard and middle-ground first half, yet having a second half so incredible that the entire thing is worth it... but that's also not exactly a great thing. The second half of this Volume absolutely blew my mind and took my breath away... but its such a shame that the first 6 episodes aren't at that same level.nnRight away, I must bring up the fact that the main problem I have with this Volume in its first few episodes is that it doesn't know where it wants to go. It almost feels as though they knew where to take the last few episodes, but lost track with how pacing and character development should work. What I find so fun about RWBY is its ability to cleanly switch from one scene to another so smoothly while connecting the dots all together whilst doing so... that wasn't what was happening during the first few episodes.nnThe episodes struggled to find which characters it wanted to focus on, what the intentions were, which unfortunately, lead to a lot of filler. The reasoning behind having this con may be due to the addition of several new characters. Without spoiling, brand new characters as well as surprising guests from previous seasons make a comeback, which only has the story anxiously put pieces together to hopefully form a story.nnIt doesn't come off too horribly, and I would be lying if I said it was downright terrible, but I won't lie when I say the first half of Volume 7 was probably some of the most dull episodes of RWBY... which kind of hurts. These episodes weren't bad, but I would struggle to sit through all of them again if I were to rewatch this season... which as shocking as this may sound due to my rant, I probably will do.nnThis is because these last episodes of the Volume carry some of the greatest episodes I have ever seen in not only RWBY, but in any show I have seen in my life. The episode titled ""Gravity"" still stands as the third best episode I have ever seen in the show (with the first two best being the last 2 episodes of Volume 3). Even the next episode after, ""With Friends like these"" is a potential Top 10 episode of the show, that's how amazing this second half was.nnThe fights during this half felt so ferocious, like everyone hated each other and wanted nothing more than to slit each other's throats. And best of all, the pacing didn't feel anywhere close to boring now that the new and returning characters finally added something to the plots structure. The whole time while watching, I knew that these new characters were definitely important, it was just hard to tell when they would really shine, which eventually takes awhile to happen.nnAgain, no spoilers at all, bit some of the plot twists also had me in shock and experience similar emotions the whole cast of characters felt in these scenarios. These situations finally meant something; this second half should probably go down as the most important part of the Pre-Volume 3 period.nnWith all this in mind, it should be clear that this is so far RWBY's... strangest Volume. The first hour or so sadly feels like a chore, which is something I have never felt before when watching RWBY, and heck, there's only 2 episodes in this whole Volume that surpass the 8/10 mark on IMDb (arguably, Gravity being an 8.7).nnBut I can't promise enough that every second is entirely worth it, because I don't know if I can speak for many RWBY fans, but the final 3 episodes will be some of the most groundbreaking, cinematic, and astonishing episodes of RWBY you will ever watch, which is insane considering this is much past the classic era (that era featuring some of the greatest episodes of all time).nnIt was a super tough decision, but I think I would go as far as to rank this slightly above Volume 1. Sure, I understand that Volume is iconic and brings some of the most snappy and well-known dialogue in the whole show, but I'm still so taken aback by how the last few episodes decided to slap me in the face with bewilderment at first, I still cant believe how much I enjoyed those episodes.nnEveryone is right when it comes to this Volume being forgetful, I can completely see that. The first half struggles so much on what it wants to be and has trouble finding its identity... but after slowly piecing the puzzle together, it ends up producing some of the most magical episodes I have ever watched in any show in my life. And for that, I could never find myself to find it truly unmemorable.",A,08/01/2025

rw10247497,tt26670955,"""A Man on the Inside"" (2024)","As I am certain many others have pointed out in the almost 200 reviews on this series, it is the best (and worst even though I mean that in a very good way) emotional rollercoaster ride possible. It starts out fairly mildly with evoking compassion for Charles (Ted Danson) as he seeks purpose and meaning in his life. The walls are closing in after his wife's death and his retirement. He has a 'decent' but not close relationship with his daughter that has devolved into clipping printed newspaper articles and mailing them to her rather than calling or in person visits even thought hey live 2 hours apart. Charles' background and personality make it difficult for him to fully recognize and 'fix' his problem - lack of purpose and loneliness. But the series is not overly heavy handed with this in the beginning, just a constant reminder like water on stone, slowly eroding away and marking Charles' personality.nnThe (improbable but believable) twists and turns that set Charles on a track to try to stay relevant offers a rich field for Ted Danson's ability to play interesting and somewhat quirky characters with humor. Not over the top, begging for laughs, but much like Charles' sartorial choices in the show, feel like a comfortable, well worn set of clothes. Natural.nnAll is good until towards the end of episode 5 (at least that's where I finally woke up to the impending blows of the incoming sledgehammer) when we are pummeled by a number situations that penetrate deeply to those of us who are of an older generation, who have lost parents and grandparents (or younger friends and family as well), or have had family members suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia. The vibe (for me at least) sharply turned from a comedic story of one person's journey to find fulfillment in their later life into a repetitive bitch slap of reality that seniors and their friends and family go through. Loss, pain and helplessness in the face of recognizing that we cannot 'fix' all problems. And ultimately, Memento Mori.nnThe redeeming portion of this story arc is that Charles, who is never portrayed as a selfish or callus person, becomes much more socially and self-aware. Recognizing the needs of others, and the special awareness from Charles' own personal history with his late wife, Charles demonstrates compassion, kindness, and, most importantly, action to try to help where he can. All while accomplishing the objective of his new (and temporary) job.nnWe are left with an upbeat ending, not ignoring the combined losses suffered during Season 1, but rather regaining and focusing on the relationships created and restored. New energy in Charles' life - and for others due in part to Charles' interactions and interventions, subtly underscore the fact that life is worth living and seeking to live our best possible lives with whatever time we have.nnA Man on the Inside hits hard at times but balances things out - just as in real life, it is how we focus on living and taking joy where we can while still mourning those we have lost. Well balanced, with laughter and tears - I am looking forward to Season 2 already and cannot wait to find out what Charles' next 'job' (and continued journey of self-awareness) is.",A,08/01/2025

This unexpected meeting leads Elliott to reassess her relationships and life choices.nnThe film has been praised for its unique premise and strong performances. Critics highlight the chemistry between Stella and Plaza, noting that their interactions bring both humor and depth to the narrative. The picturesque setting of Muskoka Lakes, Ontario, adds a nostalgic and romantic backdrop to the story. However, some reviewers feel that while the film introduces modern elements, it ultimately follows a conventional storyline.nnOverall, ""My Old Ass"" offers a fresh twist on the coming-of-age genre, blending humor with introspection.

rw10247464,tt0171804,Boys Don't Cry (1999),"Boys Don't Cry (1999), directed by Kimberly Peirce, is a powerful and harrowing portrayal of a young transgender man named Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), who navigates the complexities of love, identity, and survival while trying to live as a man in rural Nebraska. Based on a true story, the film shines a spotlight on the emotional and physical toll of societal rejection, gender identity struggles, and the extreme violence faced by transgender individuals.nnHilary Swank delivers a career-defining performance as Brandon, capturing the vulnerability, strength, and determination of a young man trying to find acceptance in a world that refuses to see him for who he truly is. Swank's portrayal is both sensitive and raw, drawing the audience deeply into Brandon's world. Chloë Sevigny, as Brandon's girlfriend, provides a tender and equally compelling performance, while Peter Sarsgaard offers a chilling portrayal of one of the film's antagonists, embodying the toxic masculinity and violence that fuels the story's tragic turn.nnThe film's direction is deliberate and gritty, with a documentary-like realism that emphasizes the isolation and hardship faced by Brandon and his loved ones. The cinematography is often unpolished, reflecting the rawness of the characters' experiences, while the film's pacing keeps the tension palpable, building up to the devastating conclusion. The film doesn't shy away from showing the brutal reality of Brandon's life, confronting issues of gender violence and the dangers of trying to live authentically in an unforgiving society.nnWhile the film's unflinching portrayal of violence and discrimination may be difficult for some viewers, it's an essential narrative that opens a dialogue about the struggles faced by the transgender community. However, its heavy subject matter, combined with some pacing issues in the middle, may detract from its overall impact for some viewers.nnBoys Don't Cry is a poignant and heartbreaking film that challenges perceptions of identity and acceptance while delivering standout performances from its cast. It's a painful yet necessary watch that raises awareness of transgender issues and the brutal consequences of ignorance and hatred.nnRating: 6/10.

The story follows a poker-playing restaurateur, played by Sakari Kuosmanen, who befriends a group of refugees newly arrived in Finland. As the characters navigate the complexities of their new lives, the film explores themes of friendship, survival, and the quest for belonging.nnThe performances are understated but deeply affecting, with Sherwan Haji giving a moving portrayal of a Syrian refugee trying to find his place in an unfamiliar world. Kuosmanen's portrayal of the restaurateur is equally compelling, embodying a character who, though initially detached, becomes a source of quiet support and solidarity for the refugees. The chemistry between the characters feels authentic, and their growing friendship is the heart of the film.nnKaurismäki's direction is simple yet profound, with sparse dialogue and a deliberate pace that allows the film's themes to unfold naturally. The cinematography complements the story's mood, using muted colors and still frames to reflect the emotional restraint of the characters while emphasizing the quiet beauty of their interactions. The soundtrack, which features folk and traditional music, further enhances the film's sense of warmth and humanity.nnThe Other Side of Hope is a film about kindness in the face of adversity, highlighting the humanity that connects us all regardless of background or circumstance.

rw10247451,tt0185906,"""Band of Brothers"" (2001)","I never leave User Reviews on IMDB. No one will read them. But this series is so incredibly good and it has given me so much that I feel obliged to write about it although no one will ever read this or care.nnSince BoB aired I must have watched it over 40 times (at least twice a year). With some episodes like ""Day of Days"", ""Carentan"" and the Battle of the Bulge episodes getting more airtime than others.nnWhat amazes me is the timelessness of the series. This could have been made in 2011, 2021 or even in 2031. It never ever gets old. I feel a connection to the characters I have never felt in any other movie or series before and probably never will again.nnThe story, the acting, the effects, the authenticity, the music....everything about this series I just beyond excellent.

rw10247448,tt7221388,"""Cobra Kai"" (2018)","Contains spoilers up to Season 6, so only read, if you watched all of it.nnAltogether: Very good acting, directing, and storytelling.nnThings I liked:nnThere are 3 main themes, which you will see throughout the series:nnFirst, there is the ""badass"" theme which Johnny Lawrence represents. 80's rock and roll, ""be a man, don't be a pussy"", that kind of stuff. Every time Johnny gives a Cobra Kai (later Eagle Fang) lesson, there is some cool 80's hard rock music happening with amazing cutscenes representing the attitude, and the challenges are often absurd. Obviously, the filmmakers deliberately overdid this, but in a really humorous way, which often ends in a disastrous way or at least not the way he intended. You shouldn't take this too seriously, because it is intended to be like this to emphasize the attitude. If you see this as a source of humour, then you will have a great time. At first this theme is also the bad theme, as Johnny sticks to the Cobra Kai motto ""Strike first, strike hard, no mercy"", and that is what he teaches, but soon he realizes that this was a mistake, and you can be badass without being evil. Johnny's character development is shown excellently both story wise, and in representation.nnThen, there is the second theme, the ""good guy theme"" which Daniel LaRusso is trying to represent. Trying to keep the teachings of his former Karate teacher, Miyagi Sensei, he wants to show kids the ""right"" way of Karate, which is balance, kindness, and defence only. While he thinks he always acts like what Miyagi Sensei taught him, that is often not the case, as he is very stubborn because of his childhood traumas. He is clearly not over the past where he suffered from Johnny's bullying, but nor is Johnny suffering from Kreese's misguidance and the defeat that Daniel did to him at the All-Valley tournament. This often causes Daniel to escalate situations to the worse, instead of letting go, and finding balance. This is also not to be taken too seriously as this is also a source of great humour that both Daniel and Johnny are acting like child rivals all the time, even though they are grown up adults now. It is very funny, but sometimes though-provoking, that their young students seem to be more mature when their Senseis are having a debate. Lots of the conflict solving between Johnny and Daniel relies on their students, or a third person, like Amanda, Daniel's wife.nnAnd then there is the ""evil theme"" which is represented first by John Kreese, and later by Terry Silver. Kreese takes over Cobra Kai and manipulates students to be heartless, unforgiving, and ruthless to other people. They teach that the real world is cruel and you should also be, if you want to survive. This causes the young students to commit violent acts, and give innocent kids immense bullying. The series involves a number of flashback memories of Kreese and Silver being in the battlefield of the Vietnam war, which somewhat explains where their cruelty is coming from. It is a very good move in filmmaking, showing that they are not born evil, but also suffered from traumas that made them like this, and how they had come to the conclusion that you have to give no mercy, because the world doesn't show you mercy. Diving into Kreese's and Terry's past and giving us an explanation as to what events led to their psychological state is what I consider a great step forward from the original Karate Kid movie.nnThe main plot is that although at first Johnny and Daniel thought they are enemies of each other, they soon realize they need to rise above their childish rivalry and unite in order to beat the greater evil, which is John Kreese's/Terry Silver's Cobra Kai. This is represented beautifully and has a slow burn to it with lot's of conflicts, reactions, events and character development.nnThere is also non-karate related teen drama involved, like the love between Robby, Tory, Miguel, and Samantha in every configuration, and adult and family drama with Daniel and his wife, their children, and Johnny and his ex-wife and their kid Robby, and Miguel's family which adds a great deal to the story. Then, as the story progresses these 3 main families are tied in more than one way.nnThe only other families that we can get a little peak is Tory's ""family"" which involves a dying mother, and an aunt who wants to inherit everything they had. And Kenny's family who has a father on a military quest, and a brother in juvie, and a mother.nnThings I missed or didn't like:nnI wish the story involved more of the families of main characters, like Hawk, Demitri, Devon and see how their parents reacted on the whole Karate drama, and how they try to interact and make contact with other parents to solve the problems their kids are having.nnOne other thing I'm missing is more side characters in the dojos. There are like 4-5 side characters altogether, but I think it really narrows down the plot. I would've loved to see more of the new members of Cobra Kai, and Miyagi Do have at least some screen time. There is Berth, Mitch, Chris, Stingray which are not that important in the story, but I really wanted to see more students introduced, and give them some meaning to the story. There is a couple of scenes where you can see random people in both Cobra Kai and Miyagi/Eagle Fang dojos, but we don't even know their names.nnAlso, there could have been at least one, but preferably two or more dojos in the Valley that competes with the main two Dojos, with two or more students with important role. But there are none. Any other dojos we see is only at the tournament, with nearly zero screen time, and that blue dojo, which Silver buys after Miyagi/Eagle fang finishes second in the second All-Valley and has to quit.nnOne thing I felt really unjustified is that at season 6, Demitri is going to the Sekkai Tekkai and fights like a pro, while the whole Demitri character is portrayed about being afraid of fighting, and hard work, and not wanting the whole Karate thing in his life. Even after he lands a successful kick at Hawk at the school fighting in season 2, Demitri is portrayed like he doesn't want hard training and Karate in his life, and there is no sign that he trains hard. So how did he do this good in the Sekkai Tekkai? They should've shown Demitri becoming a hard-training Karate student that can fight good, but there weren't any signs of this.nnAlso, I miss more female characters. The whole story involves only 3 main female characters, Sam, Tory, and at the end Devon. There could have been more.nnConclusion:nnAltogether, I love this series, and even though some people say it's corny or cheesy, it's meant to be this way, and that makes the beauty of it. It's funny, exciting, emotional and badass at the same time, and I'm glad this series exists, and I had an amazing time watching it.",A,08/01/2025

rw10247420,tt10403420,Terrifier 2 (2022),"When I ask friends, family, and acquaintances if they like horror movies, the most common response is no, they don't like horror movies that are solely about torture and gore. The terrifier series is exactly the type of movie they're referencing.nnI believe your enjoyment of terrifier will come down to a simple yes or no equation. Do you like torture porn? If yes, you will enjoy this series. If not, you won't.nnThere's no doubt that terrifier 2 is a significantly better movie than it's predecessor, terrifier 1. The production is better, the soundtrack is better, the acting is better, the writing is better. And yet, the core of the movies remains the same. People die slowly in horrifically gory set pieces.nnArt the clown never talks and he mimes grand amusement at the disgusting misery of his victims. He's a killer I noted as unique and interesting in terrifier 1 but honestly the originality is starting to wear thin. I can only watch Art laugh and point at a disfigured victim so often before it grows old. Miming amusement might be very different from other slasher killers but it's still a one-note range of reactions.nnI often think about movies in terms of the emotions they invoke in the viewer. Horror movies should, in an ideal world, invoke horror which is a combination of fear and repugnance. I never felt scared watching this movie. The primary emotion at play in terrifier is disgust so the repugnance is covered but I don't think suspense and fear are handled well at all in these films. This is why I would categorize terrifier in the same genre as movies like hostel, the human centipede, and other torture porn flicks.nnUltimately, it comes down to what you expect and want out of horror films. I want suspense and fear interlaced with horrific elements. Terrifier focuses mostly on horrific gore and torture but lacks in suspense and fear.nnI also want to say that obviously my review is subjective. There's nothing wrong with appreciating gore and torture in a film, it's just not for me. In terms of gore and torture porn, terrifier is exceptional. My low rating is simply because I do not appreciate those elements and found the film lacking in elements I cherish like suspense and terror. Which is mildly ironic given the film's title.",A,08/01/2025
rw10247406,tt13452446,Damsel (2024),"""Damsel"" is a refreshingly original and delightfully quirky film that turns the traditional princess fairy tale on its head. Directed by Edward Burns and starring Millie Bobby Brown, the movie follows the story of Elodie, a princess who is anything but the typical damsel in distress.nnThe film begins with Elodie being kidnapped by a dragon and taken to its lair. But instead of waiting to be rescued, Elodie takes matters into her own hands and sets out to escape. Along the way, she meets a bumbling knight named Sir Edward, who is tasked with rescuing her.nnAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Elodie is no ordinary princess. She's smart, resourceful, and determined to take control of her own destiny. Millie Bobby Brown shines in the role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, wit, and vulnerability to the character.nnThe film's script is clever and engaging, with plenty of witty one-liners and humorous moments. The pacing is quick and energetic, with a narrative that's full of unexpected twists and turns.nnOne of the standout aspects of ""Damsel"" is its feminist themes. The movie cleverly subverts traditional fairy tale tropes, presenting a strong and independent female protagonist who doesn't need a man to rescue her. Elodie is a true heroine, and her story is a powerful celebration of female empowerment.nnThe film's visuals are also noteworthy, with a vibrant color palette and impressive production design. The dragon's lair is a particular highlight, with its intricate stone carvings and fiery torches.nnIf you're looking for a fun and original take on the traditional fairy tale, ""Damsel"" is a must-see. With its clever script, engaging characters, and feminist themes, it's a movie that will delight audiences of all ages.nnIn short, ""Damsel"" is a damsel-in-distress story that's anything but distressing. It's a fun, feisty, and feminist fairy tale that will leave you smiling and feeling empowered.nnRating: 4.5/5 starsnnRecommendation: ""Damsel"" is a great choice for anyone who loves fairy tales, adventure movies, or strong female protagonists.

It's a pretty good score for a Disney production.nnWith the crazy Captain Silvo killing Brutus without hesitation, we saw once again that this series does not appeal to children. This scene in particular reminded me of the moment when Han Solo killed Greedo.nnThe ones seen in the hologram were most likely KB's parents, which shows that KB's parents are homosexual. Although it doesn't pose a problem for me, it doesn't make sense for Disney to introduce this classic visibility method into every project, whether relevant or not.nnAlthough SM 33's knockout of Captain Silvo made me laugh and I admired SM 33 again, it felt very forced that he was defeated with a lightsaber just a few minutes later.

I've never had so much fun in the cinema before. The audience was unanimously in stitches, and the editing was so amazing that it felt like a 2-hour movie, not 3 hours.nnFrom the get-go the crazy and addictive momentum of the narrative is spearheaded by Matthew McConaughey's monologue about the necessity of masturbating multiple times a day, drinking several martinis, and snorting coke frequently in order to function and survive as a quotidian Wall Street stock broker. At first we witness DiCaprio's adorable naivety awkwardly exposed amidst a pool of sharks, but once the influence of the daily hustle and grind sinks in, he transforms into what could be among his best onscreen performances.nnThe Wolf of Wall Street is dazzling in all respects, and incorporates a very witty and crackling screenplay to boot. Jonah Hill almost steals the show as Leo's chubby and jovial sidekick (watch for the qualuude OD sequence), while Margot Robbie hits it out of the ballpark as Leo's terrifyingly sizzling Jersey wife.nnThis is perhaps one of Scorsese's most accessible and watchable outings.

Taking creative liberties in dramatizing a subject matter for television audiences is one thing; rewriting history while presenting it as historical fact is something else altogether and crosses into unethical territory.nnPresenting Carthage as freedom fighting barbarians led by a black Hannibal waging war against the slave-master Rome is so historically off base that it's insulting. Carthage was the dominant Mediterranean power well before Rome was even a republic and like all empires at the time they were well-known for having a large slave population, even more so than Rome. They were Phoenician people from Tyre in present-day Lebanon and have absolutely no relation to Sub-Saharan Africa, which is the equivalent of an ocean away, so presenting Hannibal and his family as black Africans was obviously a decision made in order to push a particular agenda despite knowing it's a flat out lie.

rw10246904,tt0110366,The Little Rascals (1994),"My older brother introduced me to The Little Rascals back in, like, 2010, when he was 10, and he's roughly 3 years older than me. Not long after we checked the first DVD of Our Gang by Hal Roach out of the library, we eventually watched the movie together, and I really enjoyed it. In fact, I have ever since!nnBasically, this movie is a setting update of Our Gang, but with many of the same characters, and its plot consists of re-interpretations of a couple of the original shorts. The central plot thread is this: young mischief-maker Spanky MacFarland (played by Travis Tedford) is the president of an anti-girl club called the He-Man Womun Haters Club (his words, not mine), and picks his best friend, Alfalfa Switzer (Bug Hall) to represent the club in a very important go-cart derby. However, the boys soon discover Alfalfa in a romance with a girl from school, Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and hatch a scheme to break them apart, which leads to Darla turning her attention to snobby rich boy Waldo Johnston (Blake McIver Ewing), who just moved to town. However, while Spanky and his gang are busy meddling in Alfalfa's love life, their prized, undefeated racer, The Blur, is stolen by local bullies Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins).nnNow, let me just start by addressing the acting. Of course, having kids be the stars of your movie is bound to be a drawback, especially when most of them have little-to-no acting experience. It probably doesn't help that several of them, especially Travis Tedford as Spanky, Ross Bagley as Buckwheat and Zach Mabry as Porky, are simply trying to copy the style of the young actors who's shoes they're filling from the 1940's shorts, instead of trying to make the roles their own, and it really makes it come off as inauthentic. But nonetheless, the kids' acting isn't without a surprising amount of charm. Particular highlights include Bug Hall, who shows some surprising professionalism as Alfalfa, especially for what little acting experience he had at the time, as well as Brittany Ashton Holmes, who brings some realistic girliness to Darla, and the same can even be said for Juliette Brewer (who, at the time, had only voiced Rosy in Balto) and Heather Karasek (who had NO acting experience at all, at the time) as her friends, Mary Ann and Jane, which is especially impressive. In addition, Blake McIver Ewing brings some terrific smarminess to Waldo, and Sam Saletta and Blake Jeremy Collins are the quintessential schoolyard bullies as Butch and Woim. The movie also guest-stars a remarkable group of celebs you would recognize right away as an adult, including Reba McEntire as famous racer AJ Ferguson, Whoopi Goldberg as Buckwheat's mother (""Whoopee.""), comedy legend Mel Brooks as a stingy bank teller, and even the fat, orange man himself, soon-to-be-President McDonald Trump, who's PERFECTLY cast as Waldo's dad (""Waldo, you're the best son money can buy."").nnThen, of course, there's the writing. Of course, the movie does have the inherent silliness that comes from trying to take the 1940's comedy shorts and translate them into the 1990's. Still, however, there are a number of great, on-point gags to be found in this movie. There's the pranks that Spanky and the guys play to sabotage Alfalfa's picnic lunch with Darla, such as pouring the grape soda through what Darla thinks is an old boot. To quote Froggy (Jordan Warkol; voice dubbed by Elizabeth Daily), ""Actually, it's a sneaker!"" HAHAHAHA! The scenes of Butch and Woim chasing Alfalfa are pretty funny, too. In addition, the movie is even heartwarming in places.nnAnd lastly, the music. William Ross scored the movie terrifically. His rearrangement of the Our Gang theme, ""Good Old Days"" by Leroy Shield is stellar, and sounds very faithful to the original version. The rest of his incidental music blends with the tone of every scene, ranging from cheerful, to tender, to whimsical. In addition, the movie makes terrific use of songs, especially the late, great Dr. John's rendition of ""You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby"" in the end credits.nnAll things considered, The Little Rascals is a very charming and nostalgic movie, though it is very flawed, and undoubtedly silly. Honestly, it's quite a guilty pleasure for me. But those of you who like Our Gang are bound to like this movie!!!!!",A,08/01/2025

The film's structure, switching between black-and-white flashbacks and present-day scenes, effectively highlights the roots of Derek's hatred and his efforts to change.nnA key turning point comes when Derek helps Danny remove neo-Nazi paraphernalia from his room. This act symbolizes Derek's rejection of his former beliefs and his determination to steer his brother away from the same destructive path. It's a powerful moment that visually underscores the film's central message of breaking the cycle of hate.nnThe flashback to their father at the dinner table reveals how these racist ideologies were instilled early on, showing how easily prejudice can take root when passed down by a trusted authority figure. This insight is later contrasted with the montage of Derek washing away his hate, which visually captures his commitment to change and his desire for a better future.nnHowever, the film's ending is harsh and abrupt, driving home the message that the cycle of hate only leads to more pain and loss. While impactful, it feels like it undermines the hopeful message of Derek's redemption and the possibility of breaking free from hatred. Despite this, American History X remains a deeply thought-provoking and emotional film, earning a 9/10 for its bold storytelling, powerful performances, and its unflinching exploration of difficult themes.",A,08/01/2025
rw10246861,tt0099653,Ghost (1990),"Ghost"" holds a special place in my heart as one of my favorite films. Its romantic and poignant storyline beautifully portrays a love that transcends even the boundaries of death. The on-screen chemistry between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze is truly remarkable, with their subtle gestures and glances conveying more passion and intimacy than any overtly graphic love scenes could achieve. Their connection feels genuine and deeply romantic, portrayed through their meaningful gazes and interactions.nnBeyond the captivating leads, ""Ghost"" features a cast of endearing characters such as Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, each adding depth and charm to the narrative. The plot unfolds seamlessly, keeping viewers engaged and invested in the characters' journey throughout the film.nnAdding to the film's allure is its enchanting score, with standout tracks like the theme song ""Ghost"" composed by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie. The timeless classic ""Unchained Melody"" further enhances the magical atmosphere of the film, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.nnIn essence, ""Ghost"" is a cinematic gem that weaves together romance, mystery, and supernatural elements with finesse. Its ability to evoke emotions and captivate audiences through its heartfelt storytelling, memorable characters, and enchanting music solidifies its status as a truly magical and enduring film.",A,08/01/2025
rw10246850,tt15679400,Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I'm not necessarily a religious person, but the least I've learned about religions is that they have a logical foundation, despite being a faith. The end of the world, or apocalypse, if it ever happens, will depend on something more complex than the decision of a gay couple in some cabin isolated from the world. Important ethical questions were completely disregarded in this pathetic movie. The main question: If saving the world requires me to become a murderer, then should I become a murderer? No, a sensible person would never do that. This is the kind of irresponsible psychosis propagated by movies like this, it's something very serious. You can't propagate the idea that killing an innocent person is a ""sacrifice"" to save the world, that's not a sacrifice and it doesn't save the world, it's just murder. Unfortunately, in today's world, where people are increasingly distant from reflection on morality and ethics, it is easy to convince ordinary people that ""sacrifices"" of this kind may be necessary for the ""greater good."" It turns out that the greatest good that human beings possess is their ability to decide not to kill. Cain killed Abel, and this brought great shame to humanity. Mr. Shyamalan now says that, in order to redeem humanity, a new Cain had to act. No, if there is any salvation for humanity, it is its ability to refuse to kill one another, but this unfortunate director puts the opposite in a ridiculous and hateful fable. Shame on M. N.

It lost me at that point. As for the Emporers really. This had a weak ending and really there was nothing left to feel good about out.

Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (John Huston's voice), Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield (voice by Hans Conried). Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.nnAn early adaptation of Tolkien's classic with the usual ingredients, magic, supernatural events, and dramatic impressions staged through primitive but enjoyable drawings. This sensational animated epic adventure is plenty of action , attractive roles, impressive battles , enjoyable drama, gorgeous frames and being pretty entertaining , in spite of only 77 min , while still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamilar with the lengthy literary work . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale. The Hobbit contains incredible array of technical visual effects, being animated by Topcraft in Tokyo, a now-defunct Japanese animation studio whose animation team re-formed as Studio Ghibli under Hayao Miyazaki. Sensational and colorful cinematography and long-standing as well as sensitive musical score, including catching songs. Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values and lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein . The film provides amusement enough during the seventy minutes and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski who directed an animated version of ¨The Lord of the Rings¨. The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous and subsequent cinematic adapted works. Stunning direction by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr, bringing competently the fantastic world and mythology of the great British author to life. Bass and Rankin, produced and directed 'The Hobbit (1977)(TV)' and 'The Return of the King (1980)(TV)', both of which were later remade as live-action films by Peter Jackson. Both films also feature some casting similarities. Rankin and Bass hired Orson Bean to be the voice of Bilbo, and later Frodo as well. The older Bilbo in Jackson's film is played by Ian Holm, largely on account of his having played Frodo in the BBC Radio version. The three trolls in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) are all voiced by actors who also play one of the dwarves. Rankin and Bass's version did the same, although the actors do not play the same dwarves in both versions.nnThis is the second film version of the Hobbit, the original was a 1966 12-minute animated short produced by Gene Deitch. There are various roles in The Hobbit are related to characters in The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo is of course Frodo's uncle. He is also a Took on his mother's side, making him a cousin to Peregrin Took (Pippin). Elrond is actually a great-uncle to Aragorn (several generations removed). Gloin is the father of Gimli, while the Elven King (named Thranduil) is the father of Legolas. The Hobbit(1977) is well worth watching it, along with Peter Jackson's trilogy : The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) , The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) and another Jackson trilogy: ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)¨ ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers¨ (2002) and ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King¨ (2003) , all of them magnificently directed by Peter Jackson .",A,08/01/2025
rw10246787,tt2403021,The Green Inferno (2013),"I love horror, but not gore. You can have horrifying movies without the gore. Having said that, The Green Inferno is one of those incredibly gory movies that I did like. I've seen many gory movies and just don't care for them. It's not scary, it's just gross. BUT this movie was the first ever to make me sick to my stomach from that very first cannibalistic scene. Good googly moogly! I guess it disturbed me because it was very realistic. This wasn't like some supernatural strength inbred or masked psycho cutting someone's guts out in a very unfathomable way, but very damn close to how you'd roast a pig at the next party. They seasoned him, made a pit to cook him, slow roasted him, and there ya go. Gag! Now, so I think it realistic that some ""good doers"" just happened to crash land amongst a land of indigenous cannibals? Yes. That is not beyond the realm of being real. So they season them up like a roasted pig, well, I do not know, but I don't really want to know. I did find some of the movie quite silly, but in a funny way if there can be fun in a movie where people are disgustingly being held captive and cooked.nnThis is one of those movies that I can watch more than once, so I gave it a 7.

rw10246785,tt6966692,Green Book (2018),"Green Book (2018), directed by Peter Farrelly, is an uplifting drama-comedy based on the true story of an unlikely friendship that transcends racial and social divides. Set in 1962, against the backdrop of the racially segregated American South, the film tells the story of African-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley and his Italian-American chauffeur, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga. With its poignant narrative, memorable performances, and touching exploration of cultural and personal differences, Green Book stands out as an engaging and heartfelt film.nnThe Story: An Unlikely PartnershipnThe film begins in New York City, where Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), a tough, brash bouncer, is temporarily out of work after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Desperate for a job, Tony stumbles upon an opportunity to drive Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a world-class pianist, on an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South.nnAt first, the two men couldn't be more different. Tony is loud, unsophisticated, and prejudiced, while Dr. Shirley is reserved, highly cultured, and deeply aware of the discrimination he faces as a Black man. Despite their differences, they embark on the tour, using the ""Green Book""-a guide for African-American travelers to find safe accommodations and restaurants in a segregated America.nnAs the journey progresses, the duo faces a range of challenges, from casual racism to violent confrontations, while also discovering common ground and fostering mutual respect. The film follows their evolving relationship, as Tony learns to confront his own biases and Dr. Shirley begins to break down his emotional barriers.nnOutstanding PerformancesnThe chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali is the heart of the film. Mortensen delivers a transformative performance as Tony, fully embodying the character's rough-edged humor and underlying decency. His physicality and mannerisms bring authenticity to the role, making Tony both flawed and endearing.nnMahershala Ali, in a role that earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, is equally compelling as Dr. Don Shirley. Ali portrays Shirley with grace, depth, and quiet strength, balancing his character's dignity with moments of vulnerability. The nuanced portrayal captures Shirley's internal struggle as a man caught between two worlds-too refined for the working-class Black community and too Black for the white elite.nnTogether, Mortensen and Ali create a dynamic that is both humorous and deeply emotional. Their growing friendship feels genuine, and their banter is often as entertaining as it is revealing.nnA Tale of Friendship and GrowthnAt its core, Green Book is a story about breaking down barriers and confronting prejudices. Tony's journey from a man with ingrained racial biases to someone who genuinely respects and admires Dr. Shirley is both moving and thought-provoking. Similarly, Dr. Shirley's willingness to open up and trust Tony adds depth to his character arc.nnThe film strikes a balance between humor and drama, using moments of levity to offset the heavy themes of racism and inequality. From scenes of Tony teaching Shirley how to eat fried chicken to their debates about music and culture, the film captures the complexities of their relationship with warmth and wit.nnCriticisms and ControversiesnWhile Green Book was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, it faced criticism for its portrayal of race relations. Some critics argued that the film simplifies the complexities of racism in America, presenting a ""white savior"" narrative that centers Tony's perspective over Shirley's. Others pointed out that the film glosses over Shirley's personal struggles and largely omits his family's input, which led to disputes about its historical accuracy.nnDespite these criticisms, the film's universal themes of friendship, acceptance, and personal growth resonate with audiences. Its focus on small, human moments rather than grand political statements allows it to connect emotionally, even if it doesn't delve deeply into the broader context of racial injustice.nnFinal ThoughtsnGreen Book is a heartfelt and entertaining film that showcases the transformative power of friendship. While it may not fully explore the deeper complexities of its historical backdrop, it succeeds as a character-driven story with outstanding performances from its lead actors. Mortensen and Ali's chemistry carries the film, creating a poignant and memorable journey that will leave audiences laughing, reflecting, and ultimately moved.",A,08/01/2025

This is better than that, and belongs in a collection including Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation and even Harvey. Featuring No less than the then-well-known Billy Mumy (Danger, Will Robinson! ""Anthony"" on the Twilight Zone, and many others) as a mathematical child savant, the movie might start out feeling like a typical family television sitcom in 1965, but about midway through you feel it picking up steam and the writing starts to get quite clever. With a supporting name-brand character-actor cast all the way though I found it was one of those movies that you are sorry when it's over. Definitely watch this if you get a chance to see it.nnP. S. At the time I write this review, the cast list on the IMDb is unaccountably missing the movie's prominent fourth-wall narration character, played by Ed Wynn, and also fails to mention the uncredited (apparently, that was her requirement) appearance of the legendary Brigitte Bardot, whose role in the story inspired the title.

rw10246619,tt21216870,One More Time (2023),"Many platitudes and tropes made this film a bit of a slog; there really wasn't enough meat on the bone for me to sink my teeth into. It felt like a trip to Nostalgia for millennials, and really, it seems like most films and series (and ads and products and music and websites and styles and trends etc etc ) are being created BY the 40-and-younger FOR the same demographic, in part because they're the most vocal/active group(s) on social media; easy access to desires and expectations as well as free promotion means this, of course, makes sense.nnHowever, the rest of us are out here too, and although it's always nice to find another watchable Swedish film, it's becoming harder and harder to locate one with that sweet spot; something that spans generations, goes deep but can still evoke a genuine glow, doesn't signal when and where and how to feel, and doesn't lean too far into the box-ticking.nnThere are, of course the ubiquitous non-white characters and the gay arc, (which honestly feels forced given the main character's history-as far as we see) regardless of region or era, because it's a Swedish film. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything produced post-2010 without such organic-feeling ""diversity"". Ahem. It gets a bit tiresome living in an Instaworld where everyone is a tattooed, pierced, rainbow-haired, misgendered ASD-and-chronic-illness-sufferer who hates their whiteness and ""beige"" choices as to which genitalia goes where and with whom in their huge clown glasses and fillered-faces. I have big ol' tattoos and had multiple painful piercings for twice as long as many of the hive-minds out there have been around, so it's not that I'm too buttoned up, I suppose I miss subcultures when they actually were subversive. Then again I'm simply an old gal yelling at clouds here.nnThis film wasn't really made for me...but I'm getting really tired of stating this!nnThere's a recent Swedish film via Netflix called ""Thank You, I'm Sorry"", and although sadly rare, it really is an absolute gem; I dare you to watch this without falling I'm love with the sisters. See my review of it if interested; THIS is how to make a light film dealing with heavy subject matter.nnOne More Time is obviously meant to land on the lighter-side of things by dragging us through the many costume changes as well as trying in earnest to get us to laugh with them regarding this newly-40 year-old's life choices. The problem is that it's too meta to proffer much if any insight, and too hyper-focused on the character's selfishness and vanity for us to care about her at all.nnAlso, she's a 40 year-old woman, and regardless of her 18 year-old body, her lack of worldliness or emotional maturity, she has lived long enough, and apparently hard enough, to know whether or not she's a) gay and b) has feelings for her estranged best friend. The moment she sees her in her present timeline she should feel something-anything, but she doesn't. No, she'd rather play dress-up and party than search for more meaning in this opportunity. Deep.nnNot nearly as deep as they were trying to be.nnAnd speaking of dress-up; who the hell dresses like a stripper sex worker in high school?? I mean, I know that the film was set during the burgeoning (and awful) boy-band / Brittany years, and even I, in 2002 in my mid-30s was horrified at the prospects of the over-sexualising of very young girls (and I myself had lived through the Madonna years as a teen, so was no stranger to the experience). The male students would be tortured, and even if a young girl wasn't quite ready emotionally to engage in sex, the signals she was sending stated otherwise. And loudly. I also know that Sweden is rather fond of flying its open-mindedness flag at every opportunity, but puh-leeze! The objectification of women has become so common due to this ""attitude of acceptance"" ever present in film for the last 60+ years, that it's cheap and frankly lazy, while totallly lacking in a scrap of ingenuity or imagination. Issues aside, there's also no way a small-town teen would have access to, much less the money for, a wardrobe, consisting of mostly high-cost labels, of this variety and volume in 2002, and no small-town high school would look like a staging of High School Musical. Who had the energy to even bother accessorising to this extent five days a week at the crack of dawn? The apparent absence of nightlife in this town begs the question whether it would be worth the time, effort and budget to posses even half of her closet's contents. And look, I wouldn't be focusing on this aspect of the film, if they hadn't done so, which made it all the more empty an experience.nnAll of this posing revolves around a somewhat ham-fisted redemption tale that ultimately begs us to feel deeply for the main character by the time we get to the all-too predictable conclusion. This whole shallow world-building was too tropey and entirely implausible; I can't imagine many, if any women fitting perfectly into her high school clothes at 40. We don't all gain, but bodies do change shape, and these implausible details serve merely as distractions that take the viewer right out of the narrative over and over again.nnIf they really wanted to sort of piggyback onto Groundhog Day, she would've worn the same clothes she'd ""died"" in; this would've added a bit more depth, fish-out-of-water feel and plausibility.nnBut time-travel is also implausible, yet so is this woman's inability to see that her once-closest friend is absolutely pining for her in their youth. She was practically drooling, and her ""drama"" friends seemed to be hovering in the background constantly every time they spoke to each other, on a knife's edge of rushing to comfort her with such urgency and transparency, that she had obviously shared her heartfelt feelings with them. Fiona was so enamoured, in fact, that she-an obstensively successful singer-has remained single at 40, because NO ONE comes close to her friend who ditched her in high school...? A friend who's so obtuse and unaware, she doesn't ""realise"" that she has the same feelings until she reads a note, written by Fiona at 12, and squirreled away in a ""time-capsule"" no less (no tropes there), or that she's even a lesbian..?

First criticism is the colour tones of regulation grey, light grey, dark grey, and black that make faces difficult to register. Secondly there is a tendency to place scenes in look-alike locations, so that confusion sets in as to where and why our detective is there at all. Then, all the people and their lives are without even the slightest glimmer of joy or normality, even the houses are as dreadfully grim as their occupants. Everyone wears ill-fitting track-suit tops, filthy trainers, has either greasy or unkempt hair, is permanently dishevelled and also deeply unhappy.nnThe whole thing has an air of hopelessness and despair. However....as the number of murders became incredulous, and the small local police unit seem unable to handle the enormity of the bloodcurdling slaughter, we are presented with the story line of the ruptured relationship between the detective and his daughter. Both use drugs, the father confesses he had pedophile inclinations towards his daughter when she was a four-year-old child, the ensuing scene in the dreary motel bedroom was very disturbing.nnIt was this final darkness that marked the point at which I yearned for some release from the unrelenting awfulness of it all and decided to switch stations.nnI truly believe most viewers recoil from entertaining such depictions in their living rooms, and prefer to follow a taut tale of detective work minus the unwelcome introduction of a journey through the incestuous thoughts of the father.",A,08/01/2025
rw10246415,tt20215234,Conclave (2024),"Oh look another anti-Catholic movie brought to you by the usual Hollywood non-Catholic suspects; what a surprise. Sure it's based on a recent book but this crowd isn't going to be selecting books based on degrading any other religion any time soon, are they? For Catholics and being Italian, I am one myself; the plot reveals complete ignorance about the very foundation of Catholicism and the betterment of one's spiritual self throughout life so as to align with the teachings of Christ. The Church's teachings focus not on the physical but on the spiritual. Everyone is accepted particularly those with crosses to bear whether they are physical, hormonal, developmental or psychological or all of the above as it is through suffering, through broken bones and through resulting self-examination that we emerge more polished, humbled and closer to understanding the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ on behalf of humanity. The ultimate sacrifice endured for the forgiveness of sins of humanity and the opening of the gates of Heaven for all those who choose to follow his path.nnWe all know the devil works through agents and weak, spineless individuals to divide humanity as do the producers of this movie. This is the polar opposite of what Catholicism is all about; it is all encompassing, accessible to all of humanity, it is about our souls and not about our physical appearances or worldly desires. It is a means of attaining love for others, for self and ultimately achieving unrelenting love for God and all of his creation. Dark forces delight in introducing falsehoods about the Church that feed on ignorance to weaken faith and undermine credibility in the Church. This is nothing more than the work of the weak who have chosen another path; a dark, materialistic, self-centered, empty path.nnThe movie's misrepresentation of the papal selection process is laughable; reduced to a high school presidential race full of silly gossip, narcissistic political maneuvering borrowed from American politics and nonsensical drama that drives Hollywood in a sad attempt to sneer at the true spirit that guides the election of a new Pope by the College of Cardinals - that being the Holy Ghost. The Church is immune to worldly human weakness and is a vessel of truth that beholds the entirety of Divine Revelation.nnThe film laughingly attempts to turn the clergy and leadership into Hollywood-like caricatures riddled with scandals and power struggles. The producers must have been salivating when they read a book they could exploit to smear and continue to denigrate the Church with and hope the sheeple take the bait. As with all institutions and humanity, people are not immune to sin. In particular, the Church in the past was an easy target for malicious infiltration by those who wished to take advantage of a culture of silence, shame and inability to effectively punish perpetrators. That is changing today institutionally more so than in Hollywood and society in general where child molestation occurs about 80% of the time in the family by a parent or direct guardian - hard fact. This is a convenient movie to use so as to distract from reality and delude gullible masses. The whole point of this movie is to undermine faith in clergy and the Church. This is an injustice to the majority of priests and bishops who serve faithfully and provide spiritual guidance.nnLastly, in a desperate attempt to strike at an immovable tenet of the Church - that according to Catholic doctrine the Pope is a bishop and the priesthood is reserved for men. This is not an opinion but a core teaching of the Church that the all-male priesthood is rooted in Divine Revelation. This is the will of God which no human has any say in particularly Hollywood anti-Catholic propagandists. Flawed incrementalism is used in a paltry attempt to introduce a cardinal, an individual inflicted by 46 XX DSD (CAH), to become Pope. According to the film the individual has a uterus so normal female structures with masculanized external genitalia. The film uses the unfortunate condition of a DSD in an attempt to blur the Church's teaching on the papacy. The Church embraces all, regardless of inflictions, intersex conditions that are obviously no fault of the inflicted individuals and accepts and acknowledges all forms of DSD whether the three most common; congenital adrenal hyperplasia, complete androgen insensitivity and Turner syndrome or any variety of conditions with atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex. However, attempting to exploit this condition in a flawed logical framework to continue to place wedges between society and the Church is the real injustice. It seems like we are in a world where people are beginning to wake up to the falsehoods perpetrated by Hollywood and the like.

rw10246385,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"I didn't want to write this review, but I felt I had to. As a Mexican and a film student, I can't stay silent about Emilia Pérez. This movie isn't just poorly written - it feels like an episode ripped straight from a badly made narco soap opera. The melodrama is so clumsy it borders on the absurd.nnIt feels as if the director skimmed through one or two articles about drug trafficking in Mexico and thought that made him an expert. The result is a shallow story that neither understands nor respects the gravity of the subject. And when the topic involves the desaparecidos - one of Mexico's deepest wounds - that ignorance isn't just noticeable, it's offensive. In its lack of understanding, I'd go as far as to say the script even veers into racist territory.nnIs there anything redeemable? Maybe the cinematography. But even the songs don't work - they aren't songs, they're just rhythmic dialogue. I've seen a lot of criticism regarding the casting, and while I don't entirely disagree, I believe that's the least of the film's problems.nnTo the festivals that awarded Emilia Pérez, I extend an invitation: watch I'm No Longer Here or El Infierno. Both are powerful examples of what can be achieved with proper research, sensitivity, and a genuine understanding of Mexico's social issues. In comparison, Emilia Pérez is exposed for what it truly is - a mix of pretension and ignorance.nnThe one redeeming element, in my opinion, is Karla Sofía's performance.

Going into it, I wasn't sure what to expect from a movie based on the true events that inspired Moby-Dick, but I was genuinely impressed by both the plot and the performances.nnThe story, which follows the harrowing tale of the Essex ship's encounter with a massive whale, is more engaging than I anticipated. It blends survival drama with a rich emotional core, delving into the characters' fears, desperation, and the overwhelming power of nature. The pacing keeps the tension high, and there's a sense of dread that builds as the crew's situation becomes more dire.nnWhat really took me by surprise, though, was the acting. Chris Hemsworth, as the ship's first mate, delivers a performance that goes well beyond his usual action-star persona. His emotional depth here is impressive, especially in the film's quieter, more introspective moments. Cillian Murphy also stands out, bringing a nuanced portrayal of a character struggling with guilt and trauma. Even smaller roles, like those from Ben Whishaw and Tom Holland, contribute to making the ensemble cast feel grounded and real.nnOverall, it was far more compelling than I expected. It's a gripping survival tale with excellent performances and a surprisingly complex emotional layer.

Executing such a premise requires great action sequences, compelling characters, and dialogue worthy of intriguing the audience. While the first (and unfortunately, only) season of The Acolyte hits the first of these three categories quite well with coordinated action sequences which have not been seen in Star Wars since The Clone Wars, it falls short on the latter two. As such The Acolyte can show flashes of what could have been but fails to make a truly compelling storyline, which can have the effect of making some scenes and episodes downright boring.

Trigon's return is a massive disappointment and then even worse; he's killed!? Trigon is IMMORTAL by the way.nnAs you can see the mains flaws of this show are it's contrived writing and direction, its actor's are a mixed bunch.nnBrentan Thwaites is a great Dick Grayson, his portrayal may be too dark for some and I would've liked some more comedy from his Grayson but he captures the character quite well.nnCurran Walters is a great Jason Todd, his Red Hood isn't any different unfortunately but if you just view him as Jason he does well.nnRyan Potter is a good Beast Boy, however his character is underdeveloped and by the last season it's too late to care when they finally try to do so.nnSuper Boy is also excellent, along with Krypto.nnI like Donna Troy and Dawn, mostly Dawn cause eye candy but both actresses do well; Hawk is also fine but contrived writing also hurts his character. Sucks when they leave the show.nnRaven, Starfire, and Tim Drake are all terrible, I especially hate Tim; apart from some intellectual scenes his actor is terrible at portraying him. Plus the progressive Bisexual messaging with him, (I'm assuming because they made him Bi recently in the comics) was really nauseating.",A,07/01/2025
rw10246238,tt27599233,Sally Leapt out of a Window Last Night (2023),"I love a good Sapphic period drama like any old red blooded lesbian but have to say there's an untrue fact in this one. The story is heroic, I had just watched a very similar short however also in the Iris Prize series. Period drama with a ward and a family member in the house eloping, maybe this was a premise in a contest? The story builds up from a young ward in 1778s Ireland but it was unclear who Eleanor was, is she also a ward, or a niece? Or just living there like a roommate. This wasn't really cleared up, I just understood she had to go to a convent and she didn't want to. The intimate scene was clearly trying to avoid actually showing anything, not sure why. Was it rated for kids? I won't spoil it, it's a full rounded story with a good ending.nnHowever, I was very shocked to then read the blatant lie that ireland was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage in 2015!

rw10246216,tt7365436,Listen Carefully (2024),"This was a film that I got the chance to see thanks to Justin Cook who sent over a screener. What I knew coming in was that this was a horror film that was from 2024. Since I like to include independent films when I can, I decided to check this out. Other than that, I did come into it blind with just the information I've given here.nnSynopsis: when a troubled assistant bank manager's baby daughter goes missing, he must follow the instructions of a mysterious voice on the other end of a baby monitor to save her before she disappears forever.nnWe start this with a guy running away from a group of hooded individuals at night. He is Andy (Ryan Barton-Grimley). What is interesting here is that they're also wearing masks which look like creepy babies. One of them catches Andy.nnThis turns out to be a nightmare. He wakes up at work. The building's janitor, Thomas (Richard Gayler), checks in on him and we learn that Andy was recently promoted to the title in the synopsis. His boss is George Jansen (Patrick Pankhurst), who is going away on vacation. This puts pressure on Andy since he must oversee responsibilities while he is gone. It doesn't help that he has a newborn at home that they're sleep training. A box comes for him and it is a new baby monitor that is an owl.nnHe goes home to his wife, Allie (Simone Barton-Grimley). She gets ready to go out for a girl's night. This will leave Andy at home, since he doesn't believe they can afford a babysitter. Things seem to be going well. Andy keeps falling asleep and being woken up by the monitor. One of the times that he goes into the baby's room, he opens the window. There is another time he goes in there to find that his daughter is gone. That's when a strange voice, done by Ari Schneider, talks to him over the monitor. He needs Andy to steal money from ATMs with this special, unmarked card that he has. To complicate things, there is another person calling from a fraud detection company. He usually speaks with George, but with him gone, this falls on Andy. It is a race against the clock to get the infant back, but things aren't as they seem either.nnThat is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is with the fact that this is a film that I could connect with. My wife and I, at the time of writing this, have a two-year-old and another child on the way. I remember those sleepless nights until we figured out sleep training. I can appreciate that this is using how parents become sleep deprived and it is a struggle. This does use a troupe that I'm not the biggest fan of since it cheapens things for me. What I will say is that this made me anxious with the knowledge that a baby could be in peril.nnNow since this is a newer film, I'm not going to spoil it. The main conflict here is that Andy must steal 250 thousand dollars in a set timeframe or he will never see his daughter again. It seems like he's able to rob ATMs with this unmarked card that he has. I didn't realize what I was seeing at first, but I believe that he uses this in the beginning. I just thought it was a keycard for work. This card allows him to confuse the ATM system and take money. He must hit a bunch of machines to collect enough, especially since it doesn't allow him to take out the max amounts. There are little things that happen along the way, like dropping money and someone taking it. There's also a police officer, played by David Rickabaugh, who finds Andy suspicious. I'd do whatever it takes to get my daughter back so I connect there.nnLet me then shift to an issue that I have. This uses dream sequences as a major aspect. I am slightly forgiving just remembering when I wasn't sleeping due to our daughter not. I get that it will drive you insane and make you feel like you're losing your mind. That's something that I can work with. This is also playing with the idea that him feeling guilty is playing into what is happening. Also, he might not be fully ready to be a father. It takes this ordeal for him to figure it out. We even get that Allie might leave him due to their daughter. How this concept is used was solid, but through dreams is something that is overused to me.nnI then want to shift over to talk about the acting performances. I'll preface by saying that this is a low budget effort so no one is great. Ryan Barton-Grimley did write, direct and stars in this. It makes me think that he must have raised a small child since he's spot on there. There were a couple moments here and there where I don't know if he nailed what he needed. He fits this role though so credit there. Schneider has a good voice to be the one that we hear over the monitor. There are eerie things that happen there. Simone Barton-Grimley doesn't have much time on screen. She's more of that character though that is looming. Ryan needs to have the baby home before she gets back so it helps with the tension. Other than that, Rickabaugh and Gayler work as these two who we don't know if we can fully trust. Pankhurst works in his limited role as well.nnAll that is left then is filmmaking. The best part here is the sound design. Hearing the baby over the monitor is regularly so there is that nagging feeling with it. That helps with the idea that Ryan might not be cut out to be a father. I also like what they do with these voices that are haunting him over the machines as well. I'd say that the cinematography and framing were solid. They do well with blurring the lines of reality and the nightmares, so despite my feelings on using that, they capture it well. There are also limited effects, but the blood we see and the masks were creepy.nnIn conclusion, this is one that I think is exploring an interesting idea. I'd say that Ryan Barton-Grimley does well as our lead with Schneider there to push him to where he ends up. This is also well made with the sound design along with the cinematography and framing to capture the nightmare logic. Not one that I think everyone will enjoy or connect with like I did. I still thought that this was a solid enough film. Borders on horror in general but goes enough into that realm.nnMy Rating: 6 out of 10.",A,07/01/2025
rw10246195,tt2953050,Encanto (2021),I would have given it 10 stars if Disney would have let abela die of a stroke or heart attack. Or maybe even butthole cancer. Maybe even get trapped in the house when it collapsed and she was crushed or smothered to death. But hey it was good none the less. What ever happened to the good ole days when b*tchy old grandmas that treated their grandkids like garbage would die a horrible death? I think it would have been fitting.

rw10246155,tt5177120,The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024),"I do love me a good WW2 movie and I have seen quite a few of them. It's nice seeing one that is inspired by events I've never heard of before. When I say inspired, I mean it. They really take liberties with the facts for the full entertainment effect which makes it come off looking a little like Inglourious Basterds or even Overlord. I also like Guy Ritchie's stuff. He's an auteur who puts his own quirky touch on everything he directs, this movie included.nnA rag-tag team of out misfit soldiers lead by Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) get commissioned (more like forced) to blow up a ship in a port of Africa that the Nazis control. Operation Postmaster is one of the many pivotal operations in the war, that if not successful may have caused a domino effect that could be devastating. There's more to the plot, but as I said it isn't the most accurate. I hope it will inspire you to look up one of the many interesting events of WW2.nnOne of the big things they took liberties with was the violence. I don't believe anyone actually died, but in the movie a ridiculous amount of people get shot. There are also a ton of over-the-top fight sequences, mostly from Alan Ritchson who plays Lassen. He bull-dozes himself through a gang load of Nazi's. Somehow even with all the violence they manage to keep the movie lighthearted and even silly at times. Cavil and Ritchie play off each other very charmingly.nnMost of the actors of this ""Scooby Gang"" do a satisfactory job with the material that they were given, which really isn't much. They are not really the most fleshed out characters, but this is not really that type of movie. Henry Cavill and (built like a brick house) Alan Ritchson are really the only ones who stand out. Even the blindingly attractive woman is forgettable. I always like seeing Til Sweiger in any movie. I have been following his career for a long time. For someone who is supposed to be an incredibly brutal heartless person, he comes off more like a bungling smitten fool, which diminishes the feeling of danger for our heroes. I mean he dies so easily and embarrassingly. All the Nazis are inept. I also wasn't impressed with the portrayal of Wonston Churchill. Danny Sapan had a small but memorable roll as a tribal leader of the African community there. He delivers my favorite line of the movie about hating Nazis not because they are evil, but because they are gauche.nnThe set, costumes, cinematography and especially the musical score are impressive. It clearly has a generous budget and some talented people on the technical side of it.nnApparently, Ian Fleming who wrote the James Bond books was a young officer at that time because he's in a few small scenes. I'm not sure if it was necessary to throw that tad-bit in, but there you go.",A,07/01/2025
rw10246139,tt13818368,Fighter (2024),"Fighter (2024), directed by Siddharth Anand, showcases spectacular action sequences that solidify Anand's reputation as one of India's finest action directors. However, beyond the action, the movie struggles with a dull story and a lack of emotional depth, making it an average watch overall.nnThe concept of the movie had potential, but the execution falters. The first half starts off decently, but the second half drags and becomes boring. The pacing issues, coupled with weak editing (the film could've easily been trimmed by 30 minutes), make the runtime feel exhausting at points.nnHrithik Roshan, as usual, looks dashing, but his performance doesn't bring anything new. Deepika Padukone, while visually stunning, fails to deliver a memorable performance. Her acting feels recycled from Pathaan.nnAnil Kapoor delivers his typical performance.nnThe dialogues are painfully cringe-worthy and fail to create any impact.nnOn the positive side, the movie excels in technical aspects. The aerial action sequences are brilliantly shot, the cinematography captures the stunning beauty of Jammu and Kashmir, and the background score heightens the thrill during action scenes. The VFX is impressive in parts but falters, especially during the climax.nnThe songs, however, are a big letdown. Apart from being visually appealing, particularly the track Ishq Jaisa, the music doesn't leave a lasting impression. Deepika's semi-nude monokini moments may excite some viewers.nnVerdict: Fighter is a visually pleasing action flick that doesn't live up to its potential. Watch it for the action and cinematography, but keep your expectations very low.",A,07/01/2025

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a romance like a romance novel. The characters are beautiful and sexy. The plot is creative and not your typical kdrama which I like.

Callum's dilemma of being killed to imprison Aravos. So many ""Oh damn""- moments.nnIt feels like the creators got tired of their own show and just wanted to rush to an end.

There's supposed to be intrigue and behind the scenes views of what it takes to pick another pope. The intrigue is as feeble as the octogenarians playing the part of cardinals. The tension was over dramaticized, the tension that's supposed to keep us on the edge of our seat instead pulled one to their ever present phone to start scrolling.nnWas the purpose of the movie to cast further shade onto the Catholic church and belittle it further?

It's a shame it had to end with Dil (re: The Crying Game) being outed as a transsexual Pope.

rw10246074,tt0083409,"""East of Eden"" (1981)","What a gorgeous retelling of the Cain and Abel story, adapted from the Steinbeck novel East of Eden.nnThis miniseries apparently was impossible to get; Oprah couldn't get it for her favorite book show. I'm glad it's on DVD now, and I hope a lot of people watch it.nnThe James Dean film East of Eden only covers the last third of the book. The miniseries takes us back to the beginning, of the rivalry between brothers Charles (Bruce Boxleitner), Adam (Timothy Bottoms), and the woman that changes their lives, Kate (Jane Seymour).nnThe miniseries moves on to the twins (who are either Charles' or Adam's), Cal and Aaron (Sam Bottoms and Hart Bochner), and shows us Kate as an older woman, still ruining lives either directly or indirectly.nnThe production is magnificent, it's brilliantly photographed and directed.nnThe star of the miniseries is Jane Seymour, in an absolutely staggering performance as the sociopathic Kate, first as a young girl who burns down her parents' house, and later as am arthritic woman who runs a whorehouse.nnThe amazing thing about the performance is how Seymour ages - her walk, her bearing, her gnarled hands, everything about her says she's aged.nnThe acting is uniformly good with one caveat, and that's the acting of Timothy Bottoms. As the younger Adam, he comes off as mentally unstable; as the adult Adam, he gives a very external performance.nnSadly, the important role of Sam (Soon Tek-Oh) was eliminated in the James Dean film. Sam is the one who translates the important word in the Bible story of Cain and Abel, ""Timshel."" In the end, God blesses Cain with free will, leaving the choice of good and evil to him (""Thou mayest rule over him"").nnVery powerful, and totally missing from the film. This is a shame, because the story centers around choice. In this version, it's fantastic, and with it, the miniseries has the same ending as the book.nnI highly recommend this to everyone. It's a shame we don't have miniseries like this any longer. The Dean film is beautifully done, but it's not the whole story. You will be swept away by the full experience.",A,07/01/2025
rw10246070,tt31152353,Life and Other Problems (2024),"Life And Other Problems tells a story of a man named Max who wants to find the meaning of life by interviewing mostly various scientists and asking them questions like: ""Why does life exist?"", ""What is the purpose of life?"", ""What is the difference between a man and an animal?"", etc. This storyline is somewhat frustrating, because the questions are vague and the answers are vague, meaningless, factually dubious or any combination of the above. But along the way, Max drops subtle clues that eventually tell another, completely different story, perhaps the one he wanted to tell in the first place but didn't find the courage to. This story appears if you follow Max's off-hand remarks about his personal life scattered throughout the movie. If you want to piece it together by yourself, stop reading now.nn--- SPOILER ALERT!!! THE REST IS ALL SPOILERS!!! ---nnThe hidden story is this: Max is a middle-aged man and his eldest daughter is about to move out of his house. Max is incredible sad about it. It's a natural event but the loss of his daughter's company is crushing to him. To make things worse, Max is unable to express his emotions, because he has learned not to have any emotions in the first place. This runs in his family since his grandfather starved to death, probably in a concentration camp, during World War II. Since then, everyone in his family had to be strong, no emotions were allowed, because they could be devastating.nnBut this time, Max's grief is so great it threatens to break out and wreak havoc on his perfectly controlled, emotionless world. So Max starts looking for ways to suppress his emotions once again. His preferred method is rationalization of the sort: ""It makes no sense to be sad, because... (insert a comforting intellectual explanation here).""nnHe turns to biologists, hoping they could explain to him that grief makes no sense First, he tries to learn from a zoo employee who decides to kill a healthy giraffe. This man's resistance to emotions is remarkable. People are crying in his face, begging him to sell the giraffe to them for a million dollars, yet he always finds a rational-sounding explanation why he won't do it. It seems like he's perfectly mastered the skill of ignoring emotions but Max isn't satisfied (perhaps because the zoo man only ignores the grief of others and actually seems to kill the giraffe for his own pleasure).nnSo Max tries other biologists and digs up an esoteric book from about 200 years ago. Then he uses the scientists vague answers to his vague questions and the material from the book to create an esoteric religion that explains to him that everything in the universe is connected, so he can never be away from his daughter, and God may actually exists, because some scientists believe he does. And that's it. This is enough to help Max restore his former emotion-free composure and the film ends.nnPersonally, I'd be more interested to see a film about Max trying to muster the courage to tell his daughter how much he cares about her, and digging through his family's past but for that, we may have to wait until his younger daughter is ready to move out.",A,07/01/2025

rw10246018,tt7160372,The Zone of Interest (2023),"Jonathan Glazer's The Zone of Interest is a haunting and unflinching portrayal of the banality of evil. Set against the backdrop of Auschwitz, the film chillingly juxtaposes the idyllic domestic life of an SS officer's family with the horrors of the Holocaust, just beyond the walls of their garden. What makes this film so unsettling is its refusal to engage directly with the atrocities taking place; instead, it presents the family's deliberate indifference to the suffering happening mere yards away from their idyllic home.nnThe cold detachment of the Höss family is the emotional core of the film. Glazer masterfully conveys their apathy by focusing on their everyday lives-mundane routines, garden parties, and moments of familial affection-while deliberately avoiding direct depictions of the concentration camp. This stark contrast forces the audience to confront the moral void at the heart of the family's existence. The chilling realization is not only that they are complicit, but that they have constructed a world where the suffering of others is entirely irrelevant to their own lives.nnOne of the most striking elements of The Zone of Interest is its sound design, which plays a crucial role in creating an atmosphere of dread. While the visuals often linger on serene domestic scenes, the audio tells an entirely different story. The muffled screams, distant gunshots, and eerie industrial hum of the camp are ever-present, a constant reminder of the horrors unfolding just beyond the wall. It's a testament to Glazer's skill that these sounds, often subtle and in the background, are more terrifying than any graphic depiction could have been.nnThe sound design doesn't let the audience forget the reality of what's happening, even if the characters in the film seem to have perfected the art of tuning it out. This dissonance is profoundly disturbing, especially when one considers the historical reality. Knowing that such atrocities actually happened-and that people lived their lives in willful ignorance so close to the epicenter of such suffering-is a chilling thought. The film confronts viewers with an uncomfortable truth: the capacity for humans to normalize the unthinkable.nnWhat makes The Zone of Interest even more powerful is how its themes resonate in the present day. As I watched the Höss family carry on with their lives, seemingly unbothered by the horrors just beyond their garden, I couldn't help but draw parallels to modern conflicts. In 2024, the ongoing crisis in Palestine mirrors some of these unsettling dynamics. Entire communities are being devastated, and yet there are people who live nearby, perhaps not physically but ideologically, who choose not to see, hear, or acknowledge the suffering. This is not just a historical issue-it's a human one, and Glazer's film serves as a stark reminder of how easy it is to turn a blind eye to atrocities when they are happening to someone else.nnThe performances in The Zone of Interest are deliberately understated, reflecting the film's clinical and detached tone. Sandra Hüller, in particular, delivers a chilling performance as Hedwig Höss, the wife of the Auschwitz commandant. Her character's preoccupation with maintaining her home and garden, while ignoring the unspeakable acts occurring just beyond the wall, is both infuriating and deeply unsettling. Hüller's ability to convey this emotional numbness without ever appearing overtly villainous is a testament to her skill as an actress.nnUltimately, The Zone of Interest is not an easy watch, nor is it meant to be. It is a film that demands introspection and forces the viewer to confront the uncomfortable realities of human nature. By refusing to show the atrocities directly and instead focusing on those who ignored them, Glazer challenges us to think about our own complicity in the suffering of others, whether through action or inaction.nnIn a world where similar horrors continue to unfold, The Zone of Interest is a vital, if unsettling, reminder of the consequences of indifference. Its cold, detached perspective and harrowing sound design make it one of the most impactful films of recent years-a haunting reflection of both past and present.",A,07/01/2025

I could forgive any viewer for giving up in the first half hour; the beginning of the film really should have been edited down to about five minutes and in this section De Niro gives possibly the weakest performance of his entire career. Then, however, a moderately funny scene in the retirement home rescues the whole thing. Once the plot finally gets to the point where they start producing their woke Western (a movie which, by definition, they never intend to finish) it does at last become reasonably watchable and De Niro ups his game considerably though is consistently outshone by Jones. Each successive near-brush with death, whether for the intended victim, the perpetrator or innocent bystander, elicits at least a mild chuckle and it's reasonably entertaining in the final analysis.

It could have been entertaining for a night you wanted to watch a cheesy romance. BUT, I mean for a movie about a fashion magazine the leading lady (a fashion designer) and the leading guy couldn't have dressed worse. She dresses like she has not bought anything since the 2000s, and let's say she likes retro-ish, the clothes do not fit her. Somewhere in the beginning, a lady asks who she's wearing and she says it's her design, the lady is awed. That outfit looked like it was picked up from a discount store in 2000s. In one scene I was so distracted by a shirt she was wearing where the shirt was so tight on the chest that the buttons almost ripped apart. This beautiful young lady portraying a promising fashion designer should have had a better stylist while filming-I am shouting out to producers, scenarists or whoever made the movie. The outfits are miserable. I was also horrified by the sketches she showed around. Couldn't you hire a fashion designer student who would have drawn something better?

rw10245849,tt28055434,Close to You (2023),"This is about what it means to be seen, and feeling invisible seems like part of many trans people's lives, because our real self exists beyond the illusion, this is why only through delusion=de-illusion we can penetrate the veil and see each other. The physical transition allows the inner self to emerge and challenge the narratives of the illusion to help people enter something far more real. This used to be one of the ways how trans people as Berdache were serving within indigenous cultures. The ego only accuses others of being delusional for not buying into its illusion, which feeds the narcissistic falsenself that is reduced into an object.nnThe love interest at the end of the film revealed how much physical disability was almost like a connecting bridge between them, however, it is more than that, it is a search for depth and transcendence by those who have various physical disabilities, it is an exchange, in order to embody ourselves fully, sometimes we need to let go of some things, and a conventional beauty can be one of them, because it serves a homogenous norms and standards, which the ideology of sex binary has been providing for generations already to hold the paradigm within the master vs slave hierarchy. However, when you try to bring down into the body your own higher dimensional self, in a sense you can also manage to bring heaven or paradise down to earth. This is also one major reason why trans people used to be revered as sacred in many cultures for containing this ever-present potential to free humanity from a two dimensional consciosuness that keeps most humans in self induced prison. It can change the way we relate to others, it makes us humble, balanced and highly intelligent, because we operate at higher frequencies of the light. This is the sacrifice many trans people make, the way you see the world heals the world, and people connecting to you can be transformed by it. This is why trans people are so important as highlighters.nnHowever, if the wider public can truly understand transgender people, it can not happen without exploring multi-dimensionality by deconstructing patriarchal narratives of what is a woman that perpetuate the oppression of women, because humans exist in the trinity of time, space and consciousness rooted in the Elemental Law of 3 (proton/electron/neutron), let it be understood that humans do not exist in duality of man and woman outside of ourselves, but trinity of man and woman within ourselves, this ignorance is what largely cultivated an epidemic of narcissism in our society through the fragmentation of our psyche, but also managed to reduce humans into an object or pieces of meat. Trans people are an embodiment of men and women as multi-dimensional subjects the same like art, dolls, etc. This is why this world can never truly get into the depth of trans people, and neither many trans people themselves, unless people start exploring the true nature of reality we live in from a scientific standpoint, which would also help in understanding autistic people, this is why it can be so hard to explain what is really happening on the inside. This kind of movie is still waiting to be made, which could become revolutionary and even life-changing, because most people still live in complete and utter ignorance about trans people, enough that politicians have been exploiting it to erase their existence to help the collective consciousness descend from the 3rd dimensions deeper into the 2nd to trap it in the matter, so that it could be controlled through the body. This is how trans people pose threat to the entire predatory paradigm based on exploitation.nnAll things are seen in terms of duality, however, by embodying both polarities, just like like those who can give and take away life through their own body (abortion), you gain consciousness as the authority over duality. When you turn the lights on or off, the consciousness is given authority to determine whether it is on or off. Not the outside authority. Time, Space and Consciousness become unified into Mother Trinity. Which consequently takes the power away from the biblical Male Godhead, this is how it permeates into Abrahamic religion and its programming.nnThe only use for binary thinking is purely utilitarian for those instances in which consciousness, through its persona, attempts to delineate which aspects of reality it wishes to presently investigate but that delineation must always remain acknowledged as temporary and provisional lest a social cancer comprised of pathological personas fastens on to it as actually representative of reality. For example, there is no way to absolutely define up versus down without referring either to an absolute position in space (the strong absolutist method) or the self preserving unitary position of the persona (the weak absolutist - narcissistic method).nnThe only truthful and accurate definition would be the relativist method that each point in space has its own up and down - much as each persona has its own self and non self. These two absolutist methods make use, symbolically speaking, of three nails: two horizontal (the strong absolutist method, with its reliance on one nail for good and another for evil) and the third for the vertical axis (the weak absolutist method, with its reliance on one nail for its one point of reference). But reality is neither two-dimensional, for there is a third dimension for which there exists no nail that the pathologically inhibited persona can conceive of, nor is it only three dimensional, for there exists time within which consciousness expands, nor is it only four dimensional, for there exists the unification of all reality within the fully expanded consciousness. The only evil is that which inhibits consciousness. And the fundamental inhibitor of consciousness is binary/two-dimensional consciousness of Man above and Woman below that burns the bridge that allows one to access the other, where the subject merges with the object to embody trinity/unity/heart/mystery/feminine.nnIn this way one can notice the paradox that trans women might be in a sense more real women and trans men more real men, because they are uncovering their real selves that laid dormant, whereas those who cling to labels and enforcing them onto others are more prone to their narcissistic false persona that controls them. Man and Woman are multi-dimensional, once that is recognized and fully embodied, the way you present yourself can reflect it all of a sudden. Trans people are a bridge to a more authentic world where people feel free to be more of who they are. Make no mistake, it is a bridge towards the freedom for all human beings on earth.nnThe film Matrrix was based on this soul searching journey that real trans people are undergoing, which the society attached to the matrix are pathologizing and dehumanizing, because they are protecting the 3D duality matrix system that suppresses the 'truth' existing within the symbolical number 3 and its whole curvature that represents the feminine, this is reflected back by the oppression of women and mother nature herself on this planet. It is the space that frees the mind and brings it back in touch with one's true nature stored in the unconscious, the higher self.nnIt has to be understood that many autistic and trans people in general are embodying an energetic intelligence that other people are either not biologically endowed with, or it remains dormant within them, and scientific evidences are already pointing in that direction.nnFirst of all, this kind of film should explore the depths of gender dysphoria rooted in biological gender identity that directs your own entire life. The smell, anatomy, language, sound, psychosomatic symptoms, etc.nnSecondly, delving into multiple challenges in life that serve as energetic messages to the body that is speaking back to the mind asking what it needs and how it needs you to embody it, the same like when it needs to eat, exercise, sleep, and so on.nnThirdly, and most importanly, it needs to explore the truth of what it means being human. This is why the filmmakers would perhaps benefit from reading Cosmic Mother by Monica Sjoo exploring the mistakes humans have made in the Bronze Age patriarchal ontology, mistakes about the nature of being and the nature of human being in this world, including what is natural and real, and how we need to re-discover our ancient practices and relationships to mother earth herself, which consequently becomes reflected by the harmonious state of human beings on this planet.nnClose To You is poetic and symbolical, and I am grateful for having been able to read into it, it left me emotionally exhausted, but most people will probably miss the whole nuance and depth that permeates it. Let's hope films like this help people to help and encourage children to transition before unnatural puberty damages their body, so they could self actualize in a natural way, because what's truly natural is when the inner and outer worlds meet in harmony and not when nature is weaponized in order to trap the spirit in the matter by controlling the mind through it, this kind of psychotic mindset led to lobotomies and experiments by Mengele in Nazi Germany, this is how the authoritarian regimes used to rely on pathologization as a way how to disconnect people from their own inner nature. People who play God see all puberty as natural for all humans, because they have denied people their own nature already, this is the entire paradox, let it be perfectly understood that this is a predatory consciousness, it is a belief system that is imposed upon people to suppress nature. These people can not see what they are being manipulated to perpetuate because of their own ignorance of how energy works from a scientific standpoint, let alone Mother Nature herself. Understanding and holding the paradox within heals the world while allowing people to ascend in their own spirit.",A,07/01/2025

With outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography, and a thought-provoking narrative, 'Capernaum' is a must-watch for anyone who cares about social justice and humanity.nnWhat struck me most was Zain's desperate attempt to shield his sister from the harsh realities of their world, hiding her budding womanhood from their parents. His courage in trying to flee with his sister, driven by a fierce determination to save her, left me in awe.nnThe film's portrayal of the struggles of migrant workers and refugees, as embodied by the Ethiopian immigrant Rahil, added depth and nuance to the narrative.

rw10245708,tt2095004,Where the Dead Go to Die (2012),"Where the Dead Go to Die is, frankly put, terrible. From the horrible PS1-esque animation, the atrocious voice acting, the edgy shock value, to the non-existent plot, it's a mess. As much of a disaster as this film is, there are some things I respect about it.nnThe animation, despite looking awful, was made by one person, and for that, I can't insult it too much. The voice actors had little experience also, so that's forgivable. The best thing about the movie by far though is that it has some really fascinating, cleverly-created trippy sequences and unique monsters which are unlike anything I've seen before. I strongly commend the creator's attempt at these, as, not only are they hard to animate and present, but they are very complex in what they depict, so much detail is required. It is very clear that this film was made as a passion project, since the animator (who is also the writer, director, and one of the voice actors) put so much focus and effort in dream-like sequences.nnHowever, what keeps this movie from being good is its desperate attempts are transgressiveness. The movie tries to shock you, almost to the point where it's embarrassing. The film is full of chock-full of the most extreme depravities and evils just for the sake of it being there. When it a movie tries so hard to be disturbing and transgressive like this, it backfires and the tryhard edginess becomes practically tangible, so much so, that it stops being disturbing and becomes more so eyeroll-inducing. The film has next to every taboo you can imagine in it, and it revels in its ability to do that since it's animated. This film is gore-porn in the purest sense of the term, and for that, I dislike this film.

I guess some people will like it. So you should watch it to judge for yourself. Do not expect scenes like in Schindlers List. This movie is slow and full of conversations. There are no scandalous scenes or scenes with explicit grafic violence. The story is only giving hints of awful happenings but is never showing anything to picture those actions. Some will like this but for me i was missing a bit of getting shocked with possible pictures of violence.

Good portration of how some of the characters are affected mentally by what happened, though for those that are not in the wild I think it would be too soon in real life to start behaving the way they did. The gay scene is not explicit just tense making out shirtless. The movie portrays human behavior in extreme environment, putting their humanity to test. I would watch it again and would recommend.

rw10245476,tt0245429,Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001),"When ""Spirited Away"" (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi) won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003, it wasn't just a historic moment as the first non-English language film to do so-it was a well-deserved recognition of Hayao Miyazaki's unparalleled artistry as a filmmaker. Released in 2001, this Studio Ghibli masterpiece is a mesmerizing journey into a fantastical world filled with wonder, mystery, and profound emotional depth.nnThe story follows Chihiro, a 10-year-old girl who stumbles into a spirit world while moving to a new town with her parents. After her parents are transformed into pigs by consuming enchanted food, Chihiro must navigate this strange realm and find a way to free them and return home. To survive, she takes a job in Yubaba's mystical bathhouse, where she encounters an array of spirits, gods, and magical beings, each more fascinating than the last.nnWhat makes ""Spirited Away"" so remarkable is its ability to weave an enchanting tale that appeals to both children and adults. At its core, the film is a coming-of-age story about resilience, self-discovery, and compassion. Chihiro's transformation from a timid, uncertain girl into a courageous and resourceful young heroine is beautifully nuanced, making her one of Miyazaki's most relatable protagonists.nnThe animation is nothing short of breathtaking. Every frame is a work of art, from the lush green landscapes of the spirit world's outskirts to the intricate details of Yubaba's bathhouse and its many unique spirits. Miyazaki fills the screen with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that feel otherworldly yet grounded. Memorable characters like the enigmatic No-Face, the dragon-like Haku, and the grotesquely charming Yubaba are brought to life with stunning creativity.nnJoe Hisaishi's score enhances the magical atmosphere with melodies that evoke both wonder and melancholy. The music becomes a character in itself, amplifying the film's emotional resonance.nnBeyond its stunning visuals and compelling narrative, ""Spirited Away"" is a story about balance-between greed and generosity, nature and industry, and the spirit and human worlds. Miyazaki masterfully captures these themes without becoming preachy, leaving viewers with a sense of awe and introspection.nnIt remains one of the finest animated films ever made and deserving of its Academy Award.",A,07/01/2025

I couldn't largely use that same review here for the second season.nnWith the rings starting to take a hold in the seats of Middleearth, Sauron (Charlie Vickers) convinces Adar (Sam Hazeldine) the leader of the Orc army to march on the Elven city of Eregion. Sauron heads there first, and with a new identify convinces Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) to create rings for the Dwarves and later the humans. The ring has an immediate corrupting influence on King Durin (Peter Mullan) further driving a wedge between him and his son (Owain Arthur).nnThere are also continuations of the storylines of ""The Stranger"" including Tom Bombadil and confirmation that he is, who we thought he was. There are the continuing adventures of Isildur which make sense to me as I know where he ends up. The political manoeuvring at Numenor thought I'm baffled as to why we're seeing so much of that.nnAs with the first run, I struggled to maintain much interest in the first few episodes. I would say though, that whereas in that run I only really got on board for the last two, this time it was probably the last four (if this trend continues, I should properly be enjoying the show by season four). I'd say that it was because there was much more focus in the second half of the series on the elements that I cared about, the nightmares forming at Eregion and in the mines of Khazad-dum and less on .. well .. everything else.nnI should reiterate that, whilst the show still isn't perhaps amongst the ones I am most looking forward to, it is improving and I'll again be back for the third season.",A,07/01/2025

It is a poorly done slap in the face of those involved in World War II Europe.nnCanadian R. A. F. Pilot Myles Keogh (Bill Campbell) and his crew are shot down over what they think is France. They are arrested and transported to the local Irish prisoner of war camp. It seems Ireland is neutral in the war, holding captured British soldiers on one side of the camp, and captured Nazi soldiers on the other side. One of the Nazis is Rudolph (Angus Macfayden), and both Myles and Rudolph fall for local gal Mattie (Jean Butler). Before you ask how Myles and Rudolph could fall for Mattie while locked away in prison, I'll tell you. It seems prison commander O'Brien (Gabriel Byrne, who coproduced this silliness) lets all the prisoners out on day release passes, as long as everyone agrees to return at night. Crazy and nutty, huh? Myles and Mattie, er, discover each other's Blarney Stone, Rudolph turns into one of the really good, nice, polite Nazis, and soon a poorly executed prison break is on.nnThe film makers had such a great opportunity here, it is too bad they squandered it on the sappy Myles/Mattie/Rudy love triangle. An Irish prison containing British and Nazi prisoners? One character calls it a ""madhouse,"" and it should have been. I settled back for some ""M*A*S*H""/""Catch-22""-style satire, but by the end of the film I would have been happy with some kicky doofus ""Hogan's Heroes""/""Major Dad""-style hi-jinks. Campbell is a blank. He looks good, but is given nothing to do. ""Rudolph the Nice Nazi"" Macfayden is a villain, then not, then a villain, then not, then... Butler used to be in ""Riverdance"" so be warned that spontaneous yet flawlessly executed Irish jigging suddenly breaks out midway through the film. William McNamara plays an annoying American movie star, and Byrne just looks dire. The film ends with the most depressing ""what ever happened to...?"" coda since ""American Graffiti,"" and I was emotionally empty. Sure, you have seen better films about Ireland (""The Quiet Man,"" ""Cowboys & Angels,"" countless others), but when the British escape plan hinges on getting the Irish guards really drunk, 'cause ALL Irish are a bunch of swarthy alcoholics, you realize one half-baked idea does not make a good film.

I do not regret anything from watching this movie except for the fact it maybe made me a little too obsessed with the villain, Preminger.

Initially I was worried that I wouldn't like it or that I'd get bored halfway through but I watched and enjoyed the entire movie! Also I have a theory that Preminger survived and ran off because his ""defeat"" was just him crashing on top of a table with cake on his head, which is huge nuisance but it certainly won't hurt or kill you. Also, they never talk about him when they talk about the others, so I think he ran away and either went to another kingdom or he is in hiding. I don't think he died because the movie showed how he almost killed Annalise and Julian by trapping them in the mine and he talks about them dying and making it look like an accident and then he later blames Erica for it, so if he died the movie would have mentioned it, but it didn't so he definitely ran away.",A,07/01/2025

Geoff Duke is there to meet an whole host of international riders, journalists and personalities as their racing bikes are taken to get them ready for the race. First practice is at 4.45am, and there's still a little fog as the riders set off - Bill Durham, Les Graham get away ok before some less enthusiastic models need more of an helping hand/jog to coax them into life. Bob Foster is on an Italian designed speedster and the brief coverage of this session begins in earnest featuring bikes taking some fairly tight corners whilst their mechanics do some tinkering afterwards. They have to stop at 6.15 so ordinary folks can get to work on the pubic roads so they've loads of time now to ruminate in the busy cocoa tent whilst they mix with the great and the good - and all before the first bacon sarnie of the day! A sporting rivalry between the UK and Italy on their Benelli and Guzzi machines is shaping up nicely and practice opportunities are keenly sought before there's time for an evening beer. When we do get into the race proper, I thought the coverage delivered rather well as the bikes race through these tiny hamlets ridden by Bell, Daniell, Duke and Bridge. There's loads of buzzing audio as these men must navigate bends like the ""Goose Neck"" on their 500cc kit. There's also some coverage of the 250cc race too, but mainly it focusses on the bigger engined race as they can reach speeds in excess of 125 mph. Artie Friend, Harold Daniell, Ted Keppell, Bob Foster, Geoff Duke, Les Graham, Johnny Lockett all averaging over 90 mph over the first lap and the editing and pace of commentary starts to build some excitement to please the rather static crowds. The photogenic Duke now does a lap averaging 93mph - a new course record. The language is sometime quite amusing, too - not often you hear ""that's darned queer"" nowadays. Well not about bikes, anyway. The score now starts to take a more prominent role as we head to the climax of this race, and it's going to be a close finish.",A,07/01/2025

rw10245182,tt8790086,Kraven the Hunter (2024),"Review: ""Kraven""nnAs a fan of superhero and villain films, I approached Kraven with optimism despite the lukewarm reviews. Unfortunately, even with my enthusiasm for the genre, this film proved to be a disappointment.nnThe casting is one of the few highlights-there's real potential in the performances, and some of the action sequences are well-executed and visually striking. However, these moments are overshadowed by a weak script that fails to build an engaging narrative or meaningful character development.nnThe script was left lacking and alongside poor story execution ended up leaving me feeling bored, which is the one thing a film within this genre shouldn't do. What could have been a gripping exploration of one of Spider-Man's most iconic villains instead feels hollow and unremarkable.nnWhile it's tempting to give superhero films the benefit of the doubt, this one simply doesn't earn it. Kraven is a slog, and for all but the most die-hard fans of the genre, it's best left unseen.nnRating: 3/10.",A,07/01/2025

It's one of the more unique films I've ever seen, however unique certainly doesn't always equal good. The main problem I found with the film were the characters. The type of people being portrayed - fame-seeking, do anything for money, selfish, entitled scum - aren't a lot of fun to watch, even when they are being portrayed by Andrew Garfield giving everything he has to a role.nnGarfield is probably the one redeeming factor this movie has going for it. It was a strange performance to watch because I could tell he was putting it all out there and doing a great job of it, but his character was so strange and unlikeable that it almost all went to waste. Maya Hawke (daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke) on the other hand didn't have to do a whole lot for her role, but because she was the one mildly likeable character her performance came across quite well. It was a weird dynamic.nnI don't think I can recommend this one.

rw10245132,tt0099653,Ghost (1990),"While not considered a classic in the traditional sense, this film comes remarkably close to achieving that status due to its abundance of standout scenes. The narrative centers around Sam, a man who cherishes his fulfilling life, a stark contrast to the premise of the film ""Click."" Instead of fast-forwarding through his days, Sam's idyllic existence is abruptly cut short when he is tragically killed, only to return as a ghost. This aspect of the story, where Sam retains the ability to interact with the physical world while other departed souls cannot, may be viewed as a minor flaw. However, the strength of the characters and plot is so compelling that this inconsistency hardly detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.nnSam's discovery that he can communicate with a counterfeit spiritualist, portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg in a role executed with remarkable skill, may seem somewhat cliche. Yet, the film's engaging narrative and character development easily overshadow this familiarity. Without revealing spoilers, it's worth noting that the movie delivers a satisfying experience, blending elements of romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and memorable scenes that captivate the audience.nnNumerous standout moments contribute to the film's allure. Whether it's Sam trailing his friend to the killer's hideout, interactions with his friend that are nothing short of iconic, or the sequences involving Whoopi Goldberg's character navigating the bank, each scene adds to the film's charm. Noteworthy scenes also include Sam's encounters with enigmatic dark figures, particularly the emotional depth displayed when Sam shows compassion towards a malefactor in a poignant and heroic moment, despite the wrongs committed against him.nnThe film's ability to evoke such a range of emotions and its adept portrayal of character dynamics make it a truly enjoyable watch. It seamlessly weaves together elements of humor, suspense, and genuine human connection, culminating in a movie that resonates with audiences on a profound level.

rw10245093,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"I found Nosferatu to be a short film stretched out over 2 1/4 hours. I understood the historical basis but the dialogue and acting felt like a Shakespeare play performed by first year graduates. Although the actors put their hearts into it the dialogue was two dimensional, acting wooden and the performance like a stage play. There were no subtle emotional nuances or segways. They were happy, they were sad, they were miserable, they were crazy. Ive suffered from these visions all my life and if you go to the castle you will die, aaaaarrrrggggg. That night. I'm over it now, you can go.nnThey also spent an hour for the guy to get to the castle. When he went into the Gypsy camp, they warned him, then left, I had no sense of, ""better not go there"". That could have been cut. The gypsies killed a vampire while parading a virgin, he witnessed it, then woke up. What relevance did that have to the story.nnI also don't think the plague narrative was developed enough. In the original film Nosferatu was made to look like a Jew and he immigrated to the country bringing rats which spread the bubonic plague. Jews were persecuted in Europe for bringing the plague.nn""The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which Nosferatu was produced (Wikipedia)"". To see how Europeans saw Jews watch Al Pacinos The Merchant of Venice. So adapt the story for people who don't know this history.nnI could go on for hours.

The first 3 episodes are exactly the same, it could have been 1 and even after those 3 episodes it was not clear what the series was about, whether it was horror, science fiction, a drama or a police series. At some point it started to become clearer and more or less you could see where it was going until the chapter that was dedicated entirely to the gang rape, did it added something to the story by dedicating 1 hour to that entire scene ? Absolutely NOTHING because it was irrelevant to the hole story (with 10 minutes was enough) I guess it was a simply to force the viewers for some empathy and deep emotions. The lasts episodes were already becoming a bit heavy for me, the protagonist spent his time crying every 5 minutes, then incredible scenes like someone coming to kill you who is 200 meters away and the only thing they could think of was to sit and wait exaggerating screams and cries without even wanting to run.

The semblance of a plotline-requiring an archaeology team and National Geographic to decipher-keeps you on a constant roller coaster that ends with the weakest, limp resolution ever.nnThe main character never asks questions and behaves like an autistic kid who just gained the ability to see into all seven realms while on the verge of death at the Astroworld concert. I don't know if this actor is actually paid or also on the brink of death with a gun to her head because the way she speaks her lines without reacting to the mess in her script is incredible. The actor is amazing but is juxtaposed by the brain-dead storytelling depriving her of any common sense and thus relatability. What was the film even about? Any real message is cloudy, and it makes it feel like, even though the production value was high for this film, the director must have also been at Astroworld with the autistic kid. He had to have been SO high to make the astronomical leaps in logic that only someone with an IQ level of a cheeseburger could make to extract any semblance of relatability and suspense from the movie.nnThough every single event in this film feels like it's supposed to be the climax, the screenwriting ensures that any kind of reveal is delayed by subverting the audience's expectations through PULLING SOMETHING STRAIGHT FROM THEIR (REDACTED) to elongate arcs. This formatting keeps you interested just long enough to watch the next Instagram reel ad they make.nnThe biggest problem with this movie is the formatting. This was not meant to be a feature-length film but rather a series of TikToks played together in sequence to (hopefully) add up to a movie. However, the plotline revolves around this and astronomically hurts the film. Oh my god, the rising action feels infinite, as every major and minor conflict introduced in one segment is immediately resolved-or, even worse, seemingly postponed to a later reel. The action and suspense are instantly dropped, and any buildup to the climax is sabotaged. These segments begin repeating and harassing the viewer with enticing and sexy promises of a quick and logical resolution to the arc you were just hooked by-only for that arc to be extinguished within seconds. Scenes completely invalidate and retcon each other with barely any acknowledgment by any character.nnThough the story arc is most comparable to the erratic plotlines of dreams, the setting, camera work, and overall visuals of the movie are stunning, as are the actors themselves. While the characters seem to have dementia and forget which timeline they are in, the actors are amazing and play their parts effectively, even making the audience want to like this movie. The film had all the ingredients for greatness, which is why the story is such a letdown.nnThe company that produced this film has clearly tailored its storytelling to fit the format of an accompanying TikTok/Instagram-like app. It's very scary to see this dark and twisted path that movies-and entertainment in general-are taking to profit off the popularity of short-form platforms. This leaves a grim outlook for future generations. However, its sheer atrocity has also made me crave a real feature film that breaks the norm and challenges the status quo-movies that dare to stray from stereotypes, overused tropes, and mimicry.nnI hope that, through this type of content, we will eventually move past reusing the same tired molds for stories and be able to tell narratives that relate to us on a much deeper level-beyond the reach of cash grabs and HD revisions of old movies. My hope is for incredible films that use creativity to surpass what has been shown purely to generate profit. Either that, or we'll finally grow sick of all movie remakes, sequels, and spin-offs that completely stifle art.nnDid I also mention this movie was filmed ONLY in vertical 2160x3840 resolution?""",A,07/01/2025

I can hardly stomach needles onscreen, but it's the SOUND palette of this movie that might be the most disgusting sound design I've ever experienced in a movie, yet it's cartoonish at the same time. Kind of like the dessert wafer scene in Monty Python's ""The Meaning Of Life"" on acid. You'll know the basics of the plot by now, but the execution is centered in a feminist Cronenberg social critique and then skips numerous opportunities to just quit at any convenient ending point to take a detour from David Lynch's Mulholland Drive to his Elephant Man with John Waters' and Divine's middle fingers to society's relegating women to window dressing for the enjoyment of others, and still refusing to let up without a full on Gwar show finale (just as messy and just as silly) that generously delivers the gross-out spectacle while mocking our collective refusal to deal with seeing ourselves age.nnDon't see it on a full stomach.nn[PS: Props also to the dark techno angle of the film score.

rw10244981,tt0103064,Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991),"Making a movie a cultural icon takes many coincidences, and Terminator 2 is doomed to be one. It has every feature to be remembered. When I was a little boy and hadn't seen much film, the Terminator series was the one that I remember to this day. The story of human rebellion fighting against the killing robots produced by the uncontrolled AI network Skynet is simply stunning and stuttering. In 2025, as we look at T2, it is surprising that this movie, though made in 1991, is not outdated.nnThe 15 minutes of the opening T2 is almost identical to the first one, so it's natural for the audience to take the same mindset that T-800 is evil and T-1000, shaped like a police officer, is a good guy. Then, all the scenes imply that T-800 returns to hunt John Corner again this time, and T-1000 is here to protect him. The confusion, tension, and fright burst when T-800 commanded coldly, ""Get down."" The stark contrast between an evil-looking good guy and a kind-looking bad guy gets maximized, leaving everyone shocked and awed. This design in the plot gives T2 its flavor while keeping the link with T1. Sadly, many sequels of this time have neither fun to watch nor the creative spark that made the original films memorable. Most of them are only monotonic repetitions.nnThe transformation of the T-800 is another reason why people love this film. How would anyone refuse to see an intellectually 3-year-old robot imitate a handsome teenager and become more like a human? Terminator learning has recently been similar to AI learning, making T2 more special in 1991.nnAnother thing worth mentioning is the completion of our heroine, Sarah Corner. After her trauma in the first Terminator, she went through several phases to restore trust in the T-800. We can see more of Sarah's side as a mother. Her urgency in protecting her son is mixed with the responsibility of saving the hope for the future leader of human rebellion. Therefore, Sarah Corner, a character from the last part, still has a complete growing curve. This strong and independent woman, who held a SPAS-12 fighting against the Terminator, became part of American pop culture.nnEven though it's a textbook commercial movie, James Camer still instills much of his owning in it. It vaguely shows some social phenomena at that time, including juvenile delinquency, harsh environments in mental hospitals, and magnates controlling society. Though not explained in detail, these details add more dimensions to interest, and this is the proper standard of a masterpiece: Whenever it is watched, there is always something new to dig out.nnLooking back on my childhood, I feel blessed to have watched the Terminator series. Being exposed to films of such high quality at a young age undoubtedly helped me develop a better taste in motion pictures. At least whenever I want to indulge in a movie marathon, I find myself drawn to gems like ""Terminator"" or ""The Lord of The Rings,"" confident that they will continue to inspire and entertain.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244979,tt2935510,Ad Astra (2019),"Have you ever looked up at the stars of night and wondered if there was anything out there? What if we discovered that all those beautiful and magnificent stars have no life on them? There is no love or hate, no light or dark. It is just us. This is the brutal story Ad Astra tells us.nnFor many Sci-Fi lovers, one of the greatest pleasures of watching Sci-Fi movies is to see those hardcore settings and get bombarded by all those special effects, and that is a significant reason why, in recent years, films like Interstellar and Gravity have received such high praise. However, as one of those Sci-Fi movies that promoted itself as ""hardcore"" and ""realistic,"" Ad Astra has the biggest critics/audience divide on Rotten Tomatoes for a Brad Pitt movie. For me, Ad Astra is even more excellent than Interstellar and deserves more credit.nnAd Astra tells the story of Major Roy McBride (Pitt), an astronaut who is informed that the mysterious power surges that threaten to destabilize human civilization have been traced to the Lima Project. This space station in orbit around Neptune was sent 29 years earlier to search for intelligent life, and Roy's father, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), was the project's leader. Roy agrees to cross the solar system to uncover the truth about the Lima Project, the power surges, and his father's disappearance.nnOne of the most beautiful things about Ad Astra is its characterization and foreshadowing of emotions.nnIn this movie, our protagonist is no longer someone who would ""panic"" or do something stupid that makes himself regretful. This time, our ""hero,"" Roy, is a man with a closed heart and who is slightly autistic. When he meets other colleagues, he uses a smile as a disguise, but there's no emotion inside him. He can fall from 36000 kilometers and land safely on the ground, but his heart rate is kept under 80. This man is dead inside. He grew up as a hero son while his father ditched him and his mother for a space journey. This Roy, somehow still a boy, needs love. But when someone indeed loves him, he feels uneasy and deliberately keeps a distance just not to scare himself. You have to acknowledge that this kind of character is more complex and more difficult to predict. But it doesn't mean our Roy is hollow; His heart is filled with solitude, and nothing can penetrate it. This father-searching journey is destined to be one of self-searching. This is why the audience can't feel much intense in the first few conflict scenes. Because the director purposely sets the audience aside to match Roy's indifference. This kind of alienation is throughout the film. Personally speaking, this is where the subtlety lies. The whole movie, including the visuals, audio, and even the monologue, is designed to convey the solitude overwhelming Roy through the journey.nnPeople often forget how much they are like their parents, and that is why tragedy is passed down from generation to generation. Unavoidably, Roy didn't realize he inherited his father's solitude.nnClifford McBride has only one goal-finding life in outer space. This idea possessed him so much that he left his life on Earth behind and lived on the spaceship Lima for 30 years. Clifford refuses to take the truth of failure and insists on the other crew following him, causing an irreparable tragedy. Blinded by this obsession, he is stuck in the quagmire of loneliness, refusing to face his son. When Roy finds him, crossing the whole solar system. He instinctively shuns the touch of his son. That move out of consciousness reshows that they are the SAME. Nonetheless, Roy slowly realizes his difference from his father on the way and turns to human society in the end, and his father abandons himself to nil space after seeing the emptiness of the universe. At the movie's end, Roy makes up his mind to cut off the rope connecting his father and sends him drifting into the dark space. That wrinkled and winding rope is like an umbilical cord. It represents both the reborn of Roy and the death of Clifford. Cutting that rope, Roy not only killed his father physically but also spiritually. At that moment, he finally figures out that he's not going to be his father but to be himself. Although there was nothing out there, Roy still had people. He accepts the solitude and decides to create pleasure from sharing bonds with others.nnNot every Sci-Fi movie needs to be perfectly logical or live the physical book. The unrestrained imagination can also be the plain white canvas where people's beautiful and touching story is painted. Sometimes, it is easy to enjoy a film when you stop thinking and let the movie flow through it. Feel it rather than think. Then, after viewing one of them, you may look up in the sky and ask, is there anything out there?",A,07/01/2025

When I got home, I read the IMDB plot synopsis, which allowed me to check if I'd interpreted things right. If you're someone who doesn't like having to work hard to piece together a story, I recommend you read the synopsis before watching the film.nnOn the positive side, the acting is excellent. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor created a wonderful character as the grandmother - her facial expressions convey so much. The overall theme - how those who are supposed to protect us will often abuse that power, and then crush anyone who points this out - remains an important one to this day. I saw parallels with the Irish institution depicted in Small Things Like These. It was particularly poignant seeing the confidence that Elwood had in the civil rights movement get comprehensively destroyed as he realised that the rights are worth nothing if powerful people ignore them.nnThe three things I disliked most were (a) the extent to which you had to infer what had happened - obviously, you don't always want everything spelled out in detail, but it was hard to fit the pieces together, especially as at times things moved very fast; (b) the ""point of view"" camera shots did not work for me - occasionally they led to a beautiful and unusual perspective on something, but a lot of the time I found the camera movement jarring. (c) I'm afraid that I (white British person) would have liked subtitles - some of the dialogue was hard to follow - and this, put together with the other challenging aspects of the film, just added to the frustration.nnI know people who loved this film, and it got great reviews in some of the UK press, so I think for many people the experimental approach to storytelling and camera shots was exciting and refreshing.

Set in the backdrop of the cut-throat education system in India, the film tells the story of a young man's journey from failure to success, portraying the trials and tribulations of students who find themselves trapped in a system that values results over personal growth and well-being. With a message of resilience, empathy, and perseverance, *12th Fail* is more than just a story about academic struggles-it's a reflection on the human spirit.nn**Plot and Themes:**nnThe film centers on the life of *Abhilash (played by Vikrant Massey)*, a small-town student who, despite his best efforts, fails his 12th-grade exams. This seemingly devastating moment becomes the catalyst for his personal and emotional journey, as he confronts the immense pressure to succeed in a society that defines a person's worth by their academic achievements. Abhilash's initial failure leads him to question his self-worth and identity, but it also prompts him to seek out a different path-one that prioritizes his own happiness and sense of purpose rather than adhering to the conventional societal standards.nnThe central theme of the movie revolves around the idea that failure is not the end but rather a stepping stone to a more meaningful and authentic life. Abhilash's story is one that resonates deeply with many students in India, where the stress to perform academically is overwhelming, leading to immense mental health issues. The film takes on these serious topics with sensitivity and compassion, offering an alternative perspective on success that doesn't rely solely on grades or career achievements.nn**Performance:**nnVikrant Massey's portrayal of Abhilash is nothing short of brilliant. He captures the nuances of a young man's internal struggle with remarkable depth. Massey's performance is subtle yet powerful, effortlessly transitioning from vulnerability to strength. His character's journey is both emotional and inspiring, making him the perfect fit for a role that requires both sensitivity and strength.nnThe supporting cast also deserves commendation. *Medha Shankar* as Abhilash's supportive yet realistic girlfriend brings warmth to the film, offering a voice of reason when the protagonist is lost in self-doubt. The character of Abhilash's mentor, played by *Sandeep Kulkarni*, adds another layer of emotional depth, representing the rare but crucial role of educators who genuinely care about their students' well-being and growth.nn**Direction and Cinematography:**nnDirector Vijay Maurya, known for his previous works in the industry, does an exceptional job of bringing the sensitive subject matter to life. His direction ensures that the film never loses its emotional weight, while maintaining a relatable tone throughout. The pacing of the film is steady, allowing the narrative to unfold organically and giving the audience the space to connect with Abhilash's journey.nnThe cinematography, handled by *Saurabh M. Pandey*, captures the essence of small-town life in India with authenticity and simplicity. The film's visual aesthetic is clean and grounded, mirroring the raw, unfiltered nature of the story. The backdrop of schools, bustling marketplaces, and quiet family homes creates a familiar atmosphere that draws the audience closer to the protagonist's world.nn**Music and Soundtrack:**nnThe music in *12th Fail* is evocative and complements the narrative beautifully. The soundtrack, composed by *Amjad Nadeem Aamir*, features songs that resonate with the emotional undertones of the film, without overwhelming the storytelling. The tracks are well-placed, subtly elevating the mood of the film and enhancing the emotional moments. One standout song is ""Zindagi Se,"" which encapsulates the central theme of the movie: facing life's challenges with courage and dignity.nn**Final Thoughts:**nn*12th Fail* is not just another film about academic struggles. It is a poignant reminder of how societal expectations can sometimes overshadow personal dreams and aspirations. With its strong performances, realistic portrayal of student life, and powerful message, the film strikes a chord with anyone who has ever felt the weight of failure or the pressure to conform.nnThe film's message is clear: failure is not the end; it is a chance to redefine success on one's own terms. In a world where success is often measured by numbers, *12th Fail* reminds us that true success lies in self-discovery, resilience, and staying true to one's dreams.nnIn a time when student mental health is a growing concern, *12th Fail* is a much-needed conversation starter. It's a film that inspires, comforts, and challenges its audience, urging them to redefine what it truly means to succeed.",A,07/01/2025

The plot is very hard to follow because of actors playing multiple roles and so many of the uniforms and the equipment that do not have clear insignias. Dubbing does not help because it is all with the same accent. Probably better with just subtitles, but they are also not well done. Perhaps the original version made more sense to native Russian speakers. It is nice to see an actress who looks like an actual real woman, but the viewers who are accustomed to the images of naked women in American films will be disappointed by the nudity. I would have deleted it. Overall, an embarrassingly amateur, low budget melodrama that was clearly made as propaganda. For much of the film I thought that it might have been a film that was at least partly made during the war, because that would have explained the poor quality of film-making.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244824,tt5177120,The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024),"""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,"" directed by Guy Ritchie and released in April 2024, is an action-comedy film that delves into a lesser-known chapter of World War II history. The movie draws inspiration from Damien Lewis's 2014 book, ""Churchill's Secret Warriors,"" and presents a dramatized account of Operation Postmaster-a covert mission executed by British forces to disrupt Nazi operations.nnPlot OverviewnnSet in late 1941, the film portrays the United Kingdom's struggle against Nazi Germany's advances in Europe. With London enduring relentless bombings and supply lines threatened by German U-boats, Prime Minister Winston Churchill (portrayed by an uncredited actor) authorizes Brigadier Colin Gubbins (Cary Elwes) to initiate Operation Postmaster. This clandestine mission aims to sabotage the Nazis' U-boat resupply operations on the Spanish-controlled island of Fernando Po.nnGubbins assembles a diverse team led by Major Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), including operatives such as Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González), Richard Heron (Henry Golding), and Anders Lassen (Alex Pettyfer). The narrative follows their perilous journey aboard the Swedish fishing trawler ""Maid of Honor,"" their strategic maneuvers to infiltrate enemy territory, and the ensuing high-stakes operation to neutralize the Italian supply ship ""Duchessa d'Aosta"" and its accompanying vessels.nnCritical ReceptionnnThe film has garnered mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some reviewers commend the ensemble cast's performances, particularly Henry Cavill's portrayal of Major Gus March-Phillips, noting his charismatic and commanding presence. Eiza González's role as Marjorie Stewart is also highlighted for adding depth and intrigue to the narrative. The film's action sequences, characterized by Guy Ritchie's signature dynamic style, are praised for their intensity and choreography. However, some critics argue that the film's pacing is uneven, with certain segments feeling rushed while others linger unnecessarily. Additionally, the blend of historical events with comedic elements has been a point of contention, with opinions divided on its effectiveness.nnHistorical AccuracynnWhile the film is inspired by true events, it takes creative liberties for dramatic effect. Operation Postmaster, as depicted, is a heavily fictionalized version of the actual mission. The real operation, conducted in January 1942, involved the seizure of three Axis ships from the Spanish island of Fernando Po and was relatively bloodless with minimal strategic impact. Key historical figures, such as Ian Fleming and Winston Churchill, had limited involvement in the actual events, contrary to their prominent roles in the film. The film's portrayal of the operatives and their fates also diverges from historical records, opting for a more glamorous depiction.nnTHE TIMESnnConclusionnn""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" offers a stylized and action-packed interpretation of a World War II covert operation, blending historical inspiration with cinematic flair. While it may not serve as a precise historical account, the film provides entertainment through its engaging performances and high-octane sequences. Viewers seeking a factual retelling may find discrepancies, but those open to a dramatized war film with elements of humor and action are likely to appreciate Guy Ritchie's latest venture.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244780,tt22206410,Spread (2024),"Elizabeth Gillies is too talented to be here, in the beginning of the movie she got a few real laughs out of me, her delivery is on point as always but even she couldn't save this movie in the long run. On a real level she is the reason I watched this, I've recognized her talent ever since Victorious aired on nickelodeon, I always thought she was the best actor and singer on that show and was so excited to see her grow in both fields. Sadly most projects she is attached to don't tend to be all that good, this is no exception. This movie is degenerate for degeneracys sake, if this movie came out when I was in or fresh out of high school I probably would have fooled myself into liking it more, but I'm 27 and this movie is too Juvenile for how explicit it is. The characters are cartoonishly over the top, and the plot is predictable. Not to get too graphic but this is not an accurate portrayal of the porn industry, and I get its a comedy and dosen't have to be, but all the sex positive feminism in porn is vastly overstated. The industry is rampant with addiction, disease, abuse, and SA along with a ton of other problems that feminists as well as all decent people could easily identify as moral evils.

And among cdramas this is right in the top 5 for me.nnOn the outset, this may look similar to several other cdramas we have seen,like You are my hero, My dear guardian(also starting Johnny), Flaming Heart, Fireworks of my heart, etc.nnBut trust me it isn't. I mean apart from leads being in love and then reconciling after years, yes that part sounds similar to Fireworks of my Heart. But rest is quite different.nn******SPOILERS AHEAD*******nnWhy I loved it ? Because it has an actual plot, that revolves around the leads, why they separated and things that keep happening around them. This isn't just another doctor-special forces love story. We have seen plenty of those. This is story of two people meeting in college, falling in love and some really evil people making their love life like hell, every time they try to get together.nnThe chemistry between the leads work. Johnny Huang is by no means a great actor, but still such roles suit him, especially I loved his character here, always calm, composed, even in the worst of situations, he never loses his temper and calm head. Absolutely loved his green flag character. Swet, gentle yet intimidating in subtle ways.nnFL is the best part and highlight of the show. I haven't seen this actress in any other drama. But here she absolutely nails her character and emotions. She has a very captivating expressions that will keep your eyes enaged on her. Her expressions timings were on point and so were her dialogue delivery. It was amazing how nicely she portrayed the shades of her character, like when she's single and not with ML anymore, there's a gloomy depressed vibe around her face, but whenever she's with ML she is able to suddenly switch on and brighten up. Even the difference in her smiles is brilliant, like her smiling when she's single and her smiling when she's close to ML. Her smile, facial expressions and EYES, she's good , really good. I hope she gets recognised for her acting and gets more lead roles.nnOne particular scene I wanna mention, where the obsessed antagonist, comes too hard on FL, hugs and molests her. Her expressions after that are so bang on. Like you can feel that she's shocked, angry, scared, emotional crying, like every emotion in those few seconds were so brilliantly done by the FL actress.nnAlso special mention to whoever was the makeup artist of the FL, there was very subtle makeup done on her throughout the show, which is what female doctors on duty actually look like, her hair is mostly just open and dishelved, a very simple look given to her, which is easy for me to resonate with a real hard working on duty female doctor. In most medical dramas, I don't remember seeing such details, like most female doctors will have full nicely done hair, full makeup on all the time on duty. But I love how they preferred real and subtlety in this show. Same for her wardrobe. Very real and genuine.nnNow lastly the plot, it'll keep you engaged for most of the show. Even though it's mostly predictable, especially for people who have watched enough shows and movies. But still it'll keep you hooked up, as they reveal one connection after another and connect the dots.nnI absolutely loved this show and would definitely recommend it.",A,07/01/2025

It's a nice animation franchise to watch with the family, having meaningful messages about family, friendships, self-confidence, love and respect for nature etc. Which can emotionally resonate with almost everyone, having a beautiful exotic scenery and telling of old legends of Hawaii. But...nMoana 2 lacked ""a lot"" as not having much of a story and a ""good enough"" musical quality. As it was like the same thing once again(?), with insignificant characters like the Bat Lady Matangi or the old farmer Keke and situations that looked like stretch for the feeling of an adventure like the monster clam thing...nUnfortunately most of the songs seemed weaker than the first. Honestly I liked the melody and the structure of the new Moana song ""Beyond"" however the lyrics were like ""A. I. generated"", sucking the the soul and meaning from the original ""How Far I'll Go"".nnThere weren't many memorable and well written songs in this one I must say. ""Can I Get a Chee Hoo"" was horrible... Just like ""Get Lost"" which was also quite irrelevant with the general tone, sounded more like an adult-related theme(?)... The singing and voice-acting performances were quite good though but without much meaning or emotion, they fell flat.nnThe artistic quality of the visuals were top-nocth as it is a Disney brand but Moana 2 didn't introduce anything new or appealing visually either. Knowing that it was planned for TV series earlier and turned into a theatrical release, I guess it was a little bit rushed and not well-prepared for the movie theatre screening. The story about Moana becoming a demi-goddess could have been told much better if the creative team had given more time to finesse their work.nnMoana 2 has a very predictable ending as expected but it also does not evoke such strong emotions, well because Moana doesn't do anything that she hasn't done before (sail, swim, sing and drown) literally (!). She definitely goes beyond but how and why she comes back is a mystery... ""because it's her destiny so shut up!"", one would say I presume.nnThe message was confusing either: ""Risky your life for your impossible dreams, dont worry, even if you die, you will be rewarded / resurrected...?"" Doesn't it feel dangerous to anyone?...nAnyway, children will still enjoy Moana 2 because of the theme of sisterhood, funny and awkward situations, Moana's pets, the Kakamoras etc. But it's very unlikely that children will enjoy the songs in this one better than the first...

It's just sadism porn centred around a horrible musician who has no idea how to have normal human interactions, and a kid who wants to be the greatest in spite of absolutely no one telling him he can or should be.nnThe subtleties of the drumming tempo are only noticeable to a trained ear, which I don't know maybe trained drummers get a kick out of guessing if it's right or wrong? Because I sure didn't. Fletcher's teaching techniques wouldn't even suit the military let alone a stage band. He provides absolutely no proper feedback and doesn't build up anyone's confidence. The entire time I was waiting for his character arc to find an ""aha"" moment where he suddenly makes the student realise his potential and shows him that he respects him, but there was none of that. It's just a movie about a guy we're supposed to hate and a kid we have no reason to believe in.nnNot only is he so unlikable that we can't find a reason to respect his methods, but his character gets fired for his prolific bullying. So then what, we're supposed to feel sorry for him that he's a hardass who people didn't understand?nnNo, he's just a bad person.nnHe then goes on to tell the kid that he needs a drummer for a show coming up, and he needs someone who ""really knows the parts"". After we just watched him talk trash about him the entire movie so far telling him he's a terrible drummer? Nothing about his backstory commands the respect required to give us a reason to believe this change of heart. If any person treated you this way and then asked you to play in their band you'd tell them to get stuffed.nnWhich culminates in a moment of terror inducing confrontation right as they're about to play on stage that Fletcher knew the kid was the reason he was fired, because he was the one who spoke out at the behest of his father. The entire show Fletcher gives him the eyes just to further terrorise him. For what? To what end? He's a proud guy, he knows a band member screwing up on stage only makes him look worse. I'm left astounded and confused as to the entire reason this all happens. The kid walks off.nnBut no, he has to show him he's the best so he goes back out and plays. Taking over the show without Fletcher's conduction.nnAgain, for a guy we have no reason to believe is the musical great he claims to be.nnThen they suddenly just decide to respect each other right there on stage over the love of music, even though one of them starts the show with psychological warfare and the other tries to prove a point with an upstaging performance that in real life as an audience member I I can only imagine I'd be cringing out of my seat.nnNot to mention how pissed the rest of the band would be at a ring-in suddenly calling the shots on the kit.nnIt's nonsense.nnThis movie made me feel emotions, but none of them were good.

Furthermore it have come to my attention, every subtle details, music, and cinematography that conveys the deepest message of today's world problem, that everyone doesn't have to conform to a label in order to be normal.

rw10244574,tt17526714,The Substance (2024),"I put off seeing this for a pretty good while because of some apparently unusually-sensitive IMDB reviewers complaining about how explicit it is and even referring to it as p**n. Others complained about the language.nnFolks, I'm pretty conservative in my personal life, but one thing I do understand and value is the need for storytellers to be able to reflect certain fundamental realities of life in unashamed ways.nnDid you know that underneath our clothes all of us have naked bodies? It's true. Naked bodies are a real thing in real life. Some of you out there seem to be in denial about this, or to equate nakedness with only you-know-what. Boy, I bet you're all a party to walk around a sculpture garden with.nnThere is nothing sexually explicit in this film. Your ability to watch it and enjoy it without getting all uncomfortable and feeling a need to cleanse your conscience with a review here on IMDB will depend entirely on maturity.nnTo tell this particular story - which is outstanding by the way, and deals with real issues involving the real human condition, particularly from a female perspective in certain industries, but for men in certain industries also - everything that made it into the final cut of this film is necessary. That means the nudity, the cussing, the everything. Take those things out, the story loses all weight and significance. Furthermore, this is a story that can ONLY be told with these very specific types of characters - otherwise, again, it loses all weight and significance.nnEven Dennis Quaid's character - who many I'm sure will find abrasive, off putting, and frankly, disgusting - perfectly reflects real people walking around out there in the real world who truly are of this type! His character really does exist out here in the real world. Quaid plays the character to perfection to create just the right amount of nausea.nnHonestly, the artistic skill that went into just about every decision involved with this movie is impressive - from the opening shot and throughout. The pacing is amazing, the camera work is amazing, the actors are amazing, the story is amazing, the details in how the whole fictional premise for this story works is well thought out and amazing.nnYes, Demi Moore deserves every bit of praise she is getting right now for her part in this. What a bold (and brave) decision. A better actress could not have been cast here considering the stage of life she's in, and her career. The fact that she's so well known, and so many of us have followed her life and have watched her aging in the real world compliments and gives weight to the fictional character in the mind of the audience.nnWill absolutely be remembered as one of the best movies of the year.",A,07/01/2025

After reaching the halfway mark, here is what I have found:n1) Better than the Acolyte, but tbh thats not even hard to do as the Acolyte is simply the WORST. I'd say this show is slightly better than BoBF and slightly worse than Obi-Wan.nn2) Episodes 1 and 2 are the only interesting episodes I've encountered so far. Episode 3 was meh and episode 4 was stupid.nn3) There is no sense of mystery, adventure, and there is only slight action. No detailed plot or anything.

Take Rebels for instance, which is very much a kids show but it is still fun to watch when your older also.nnIdk, it just really seems to me that disney puts a lack of effort into anything they come up with now. It is very depressing, seeing my favorite franchise of all time die. The last hope for star wars is Andor season 2. If that flops, than star wars might be officially dead. Also, if Andor season 2 flops than Kathleen Kennedy had better get fired along with Bob Iger etc.nnThis Show: 5/10nFuture of SW: Very Uncertain.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244555,tt0711514,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" (1972) {Cry Help! (#3.9)}","In the 1970s child abuse was a taboo subject. No level of abuse by parents or schools was deemed excessive. Indeed, only 3 years after this film was made, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was perfectly acceptable to beat a child with the equivalent of a baseball bat to the point of requiring medical treatment and 3 days of bed rest. That boy was about the same age as character Paul Harris in this teleplay. Many people have complained the plot is too transparent but I was fooled on first viewing and enjoyed the twists. Malden gets to show his softer side in this episode while Douglas gets to show his indigation over pursing terrified child. But the screenwriter missed an opportunity to show the real terror of a child who feels abandoned by everyone in his life. But perhaps that was just too strong for the broadcast standards of the time. Unfortunately, David Gruner, who was 17 at the time of filming, isn't convincing as a 13-year-old, but that's a minor complaint. Marietta Hartley took a break from selling Polaroid cameras to guest star in this episode. Her performance is a bit uneven but that may be due to the script or direction. We should have more foreshadowing of how her character is resolved. Marge Redmond, who plays the foster mother, always raises the bar in these cameo roles. There are a couple of problems with the logic in the script. For one thing, a child who shows visible abuse should have been immediately removed from the home. And I rather doubt foster children can be adopted the first week they're in their new home. Well, maybe Lt. Mike Stone pulled a few strings downtown?",A,07/01/2025

rw10244476,tt1345836,The Dark Knight Rises (2012),"""When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die.""nnThe Dark Knight Rises will forever be known as one of the greatest finale's in film history. Up there with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Here is my review for the final Christopher Nolan, Batman installment.nnActing: I'm gonna start with Tom Hardy as Bane. For me, he was the highlight of the entire movie. He had a very strong pressence and unlike the typical cliche villains, Bane was actually a frightening in the film. He couldn't use his face to express emotion because of the mask but Tom's performance was so brillaint I was legit terrified of this man, and I haven't been scared of anything in a movie since I was eight! Now, Anne Hathaway also blew me away. I liked her as an actress but I really couldn't see her as Catwoman. The previews with her in it just wasn't impressing me and convincing me that she is Selina Kyle. I was proven wrong. She was absolutely AMAZING as the character. I personally still prefer Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman but Anne is close second. Joseph Gordon Levitt, I didn't expect nothing less from him. I've always liked Joseph Gordon Levitt ever since I saw him in G. I Joe (I actually liked that movie and felt he was a highlight) and him playing John Blake was great.nnChristian Bale gave probably his best performance in any film he's done. He was just great as a broken Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine, I felt was a little weak in this movie. When he cried both times in the movie, I just wasn't buying it. I don't mean I didn't like him in it, I just don't think he was better in this than the others. Marrion Cotillard, I have never liked her. She was weak in Inception and I think she was slightly better in this film. I did like the twist involving her though. Morgan Freeman was good as always, I mean he is Morgan Freeman. He isn't a bad actor. But, this trilogy didn't showcase his acting abilities a whole light. Although, I felt he was the heart of the entire trilogy.nnWriting: I felt the writing was also the best out of the entire trilogy. It had me on the edge of my seat literally in every exciting part of the film. It wasn't as clever as The Dark Knight but it definitely does what a movie like this is suppose to do.nnDirection: Christopher Nolan, his vision for the Batman franchise not only brought new life in the franchise but also showed that not all comicbook movies and characters are as light hearted and fun as a character like Spider-Man. This film IS his masterpiece. Anyone (in my opinion) who feels that The Dark Knight is his masterpiece, especially talking the trilogy alone is probably still mezmerised (sorry if I spelled that wrong) by Heath Ledger's Joker, believe me I am too.nnEditing: The editing is wonderful in this film. It keeps the story flowing as it should. No confusing fights, nothing dragging.nnFight Choreography: The fight choreography is great. The fights in Batman Begins were a little weak and there was hardly any fighting in The Dark Knight. The fights that were there were hardly better than Batman Begins. I think the fighting here is brutal as it should be, on the edge of your seat, scary fighting. Especially the first encounter between Batman and Bane. *spoiler for those who have yet to see it* I was actually a little bit surprised when Bane broke the bat. Believe me, deep inside I was all excited but at the same time I was in shock and a little saddened for Batman. *spoiler end*nnEnd results: The Dark Knight Rises is without doubt, the best of the trilogy and perfectly ends what I feel is the greatest trilogy I have ever seen. Powerfuly performances, strong script and a director who knows what he is doing. The Dark Knight Rises left me with happiness in my heart in the end despite my fear through out the movie. I feel this is like The Avengers, in the sense that this is a MUST SEE in the theater.

He uses his skills both for photo shoots and live performances at an S&M club. He saves a woman who was being attacked and learns she is searching for her sister who has been working as bondage model. He agrees to help search.nnThis is a modern Pink Eiga. There is limited nudity. There are some sex scenes. And there is a lot of bondage along with limited discipline. S&M is a definite theme for this film. The Bondage and S&M elements were handled without being truly mean or degrading. In fact at times it was with a slight sense of humor and always with being consensual.nnThis is one story with several sub-stories tied in. This kept the entire film interesting. A bit of crime drama, drama with some comedy. The characters are very interesting too.nnThe biggest problem is with the English dubbing. I will need to see the original Japanese version but I didn't like some of the English voices & performances. Most sound like what you'd hear in a bad B movie from the 1980's. Played way over the top for comic relief. One character is the single totally stupid character often in B movies.

rw10244436,tt23870986,"""Disclaimer"" (2024) {VII (#1.7)}","I liked this show because it's interesting, but truth is, it's not a very satisfying program. Great acting, of course, it's got great actors. The story is entirely intriguing and for the most part keeps you hooked in the 'what's gonna happen next?' loop because it does move at a nice pace. With 7 episodes it's not too long of a series and allows for each section of the story to have it's full time up front.nnBut none of the characters are likable. Seriously. They're all pretty self-absorbed, shallow people. I know lots of real folks are like that but basically 6 out of 10 people will have SOME kind of redeeming quality in their personality. The only character I got happy seeing was the cat. He's a cat so he always makes me go AWEEE...but everyone else, it's pretty hard to really care if things go right for them. Even in the scenes of her in her office, her co-workers weren't overly good folks either. Was it in the water? They seemed shallow, fake, even the lines stated were about how the Jr editing assistant (or whatever) was only being how she was (faking sincerity) to get something out of the bad guy to one-up Cate Blanchette's character. I mean, if even the lines are serving up this thought because it's how they are then....nnBut then the last episode reminds you that in a way it's always BEEN a set up. When we finally are getting the truth of what happened that day and night of the original interaction before he drowned (he raped her..for hours) we're made to understand that, now that we know, we're supposed to feel horror and sympathy for her. Gee, don't we feel bad we kinda despise her?nnAnd no, I couldn't. Why? Because logically speaking she could have prevented the ENTIRE drama by coming out with her truth in the beginning. Her son wouldn't have been victimized, almost dead then. Her husband wouldn't have had to realize his wife was a liar, which she STILL was even after she told him she was raped instead. By letting him think the worst, she set him up to LOOK bad in his anger at her. She set him up with that! What was he SUPPOSED to do?nnThen after the truth came out, she decided she couldn't forgive him for being angry at her for a fake affair because as soon as he knew it was actually a rape he had different feelings and reactions? How DARE she!nnHe wasn't happy she had an affair because that is about CHOICE! Of course he won't like it. Might even want to punish her for it.nnRAPE is a whole different reaction ballpark. But she took that AWAY from him! Because SHE didn't want him to have to deal with it in the beginning, then decided she didn't like how he reacted once he knew the truth?nnYah..I still don't like HER. But him, the husband?

rw10244430,tt6217306,Apostle (2018),"'Apostle' follows a man who is on a mission to rescue his sister, who has been captured by a sect demanding ransom over its declining society. It is learned that the community lives on a separate island offshore England, after the founding fathers fled from the mainland fearing persecution by the King.nnAs time goes by, the community grows larger, welcoming immigrants who have a special ticket to enter Eridens. All people who board this settlement must devote themselves, including offering their blood to the Queen of the land.nnThomas's journey as the protagonist is far from easy, as he must blend in with the community's customs and practices, essentially becoming a new resident. Thanks to the King's envoy, who is instructed to assassinate the cult leader, Prophet Malcolm, Thomas accidentally gains Malcolm's respect by stopping the envoy's attempt, even though he injures him in the process.nnThe plot progresses slowly, digging deeper and deeper into the island's darkest secret until Thomas eventually discovers the Queen, who had kept the island fertile in the past but is now in a dying state. The Queen is embedded with the plantation's tendrils creeping inside her body. She is covered with roots and in an almost vegetative state, consuming only blood as the source of the island's fertility.nnHowever, while the plot is well-written, I feel the movie is somewhat flat and bland. Despite the revelation of the gory Queen, the atmosphere the creators aimed to convey does not reach the audience well. The fact that Malcolm is slowly losing his popularity, adding to the 'spiraling' effect of the movie, does not help much in creating a dreadful atmosphere. The lack of 'uncanny' acting may be a factor in this result. If such acting were executed correctly, it would be a decisive element in this film to evoke a terrifying feeling. I always compare one film to another in my IMDB reviews, so putting this work alongside some of A24's pictures is not over the top.nnA24, with the likes of Midsommar and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, has been successful in delivering an uneasy feeling to spectators. The cast is instructed to show flat emotions, making us wonder what the characters actually feel. The unfolding mystery before our eyes ultimately provides an eerie feeling, which is vital to such a work.nnOverall, Apostle displays some solid performances with a few flaws.

Jack Palance, in one of his earlier roles, looks almost TOO wooden -- and his acting certainly is. Gloria Grahame doesn't come out of this unscathed. Although she attempts her chops as the femme fatale, you can't buy it, because she looks like a duck.nnNot to try to spoil it (as it is already horrible, not too much chance of that) -- but she has ample opportunities to bring someone else in to quash the baddies plot. WAY too many chances. Yet she followed her ridiculously inept plan to it's anticlimactic -- and extremely disappointing finish.nnDo yourself a favor and AVOID this.

Doroga iz zhyoltogo kirpicha (2025),"""The Wizard of the Emerald City"" (2025): A Disappointing Journey into FantasynThe film The Wizard of the Emerald City, which premiered in January 2025, sparked a wave of discontent among viewers. Expectations were high for this ambitious project, supported by the Russian Cinema Fund, but reality fell short, leaving audiences disappointed. Let's analyze what went wrong.nnBudget and ExecutionnOne of the primary complaints from viewers is the film's visual component. Despite claims of a significant budget, the movie's graphics feel outdated and fail to meet modern standards. At times, the special effects resemble those seen in early 2000s films, when visual effects technology was still in its infancy.nnPlot StructurenThe script feels fragmented and underdeveloped. The narrative unfolds superficially, lacking deep character development or emotional engagement. The most glaring issue is that the film ends halfway through the story, leaving audiences without a complete narrative arc. This abrupt cutoff is especially frustrating for viewers expecting a cohesive story.nnNegative Role Model for Children: The Case of EllienThe portrayal of the main character, Ellie, deserves special attention. Instead of showcasing her as a strong and determined figure growing through her journey, the film presents her as a capricious and self-centered girl overly reliant on others' help. This approach risks promoting a negative behavioral model, especially for young viewers who might look to Ellie as a role model.nnEllie frequently acts like an immature character, seeking validation and direction from others rather than developing her own skills and decisions. Unlike the original story, where Ellie is portrayed as more independent and resolute, this adaptation undermines essential qualities such as self-reliance and responsibility.nnFurthermore, the film endorses a troubling pattern of behavior in which betraying friends remains unpunished if it serves Ellie's goals. She makes choices that undermine trust and violate moral principles, but these actions are ultimately forgiven with mere weak apologies. This sends a dangerous message: that betraying trust and prioritizing personal goals over friendships carries no serious consequences. For a young audience, this is a deeply concerning takeaway.nnUnexpected Ending and Marketing MisstepsnOne of the most contentious aspects is the lack of prior disclosure that the film is only the first part of a larger story. The abrupt plot cutoff provoked widespread discontent since viewers were not informed about this format. Advertising materials and the film's description led audiences to expect a complete, standalone work, which some see as misleading.nnEthical and Legal ConcernsnFrom a legal perspective, the creators' actions could be interpreted as a violation of consumer rights. Russian law requires full and accurate disclosure of product or service information. If the omission of the film's sequel was intentional, it could be classified as unfair practice.nnPositive AspectsnIt is worth noting that the film does have some strengths. The musical score effectively enhances the atmosphere, and certain visual elements are commendable. Additionally, despite its flaws, the project managed to draw attention to Russian cinema-albeit with a negative undertone.nnConclusionnThe Wizard of the Emerald City turned out to be a disappointing project that failed to meet audience expectations despite significant investments. Outdated visuals, inefficient budget use, an underwhelming script, and the lack of transparency regarding its format as ""part one"" all contribute to the overall sense of frustration. Negative elements, such as poor character portrayal and the promotion of selfish behavior, further exacerbate the film's shortcomings. The movie leaves viewers with a sense of incompleteness, and unless the creators address these issues moving forward, the project risks not only failure but also losing the audience's trust.",A,07/01/2025

Then he confesses to Jerry that he's MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER! Excuse meeee?!! She was literally a baby in your hand, you raised her since she was 6 and watched her grow up... I tell you it's creepy... it's messed up... It's f****d up!!!nnI mentioned that that was the case in many silent films I mentioned before, but at least the girlies didn't end up with the adopting father! While here, no, they reconcile at the end and share another long kiss, curtains down.nnPhew, that was pretty exhausting. As you have read the theme here was actually common in the that (and the silent) era, I can't really figure it out WHY?! Did the audience of the past really enjoyed such twisted stories?! It seems yes (Evidence is the contemporary reviews didn't mind it, photoplay called it pleasant and celebrated Michael ""winning"" Mitzi!, so did new york times) I that's the past, but today this film would be controversial and considered ""ped*phelia"", as it should be. (So was Woody Allen inspired by this film to have his notorious affair?! Life does imitate art!)nnIt is such a shame this rare film had such a frustrating theme, because it's told in style and talent, the cast are excellent, the directing is smooth, but those won't redeem the heinous affair.nnThe closing line of the film (I wrote it up first in this review) has traumatized me... It seems it will haunt me for a long time!",A,07/01/2025
rw10244266,tt1259528,Den of Thieves (2018),"I rarely, if ever, write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this movie. It's disheartening to see the current state of film when a movie like this manages to secure a seven rating on IMDb. Frankly, that score feels far too generous. Everything about this film-from the plot to the performances-was painfully average and forgettable. The characters were so underdeveloped and lifeless that I couldn't bring myself to care about a single one of them, not even in the slightest. If you're considering watching this, I urge you to save your time and energy. Instead, revisit a true masterpiece like Heat-a film that delivers intensity, depth, and emotion. Watching Heat a hundred times over would still be a better use of your time than sitting through this uninspired mediocrity.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244262,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Dutch writer/director Halina Reijn's new feature 'Babygirl' is an exercise in boldness. The film is a fresh take on the age old story of self-discovery and self-destruction.nnIn the movie Nicole Kidman plays Romy, a highly successful CEO of a robotics company by day and sexual submissive by night. Despite having a picture-perfect home life with a loving husband and two daughters, Romy remains unseen and sexually unsatisfied until she meets an intern (Samuel) at her company who sees a side of her that's she's been hiding - her sexual identity.nnTwo older films come to mind when watching 'Babygirl' - Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful'. All three deal with infidelity and the razor's edge one walks when engaging in it. What stands out in 'Babygirl' is the feral, masochistic nature of Romy and Samuel's illicit encounters which leave Romy in equal parts exhilarated, scared, embarrassed and liberated.nnReijn's film presents an unvarnished view into shifting power differentials. The CEO has power over an intern just as much as a dom has power over a sub. Romy the titan gives in to the commands of Samuel the peon. Their initial encounters are awkward and uncomfortable both for them and the audience. It's like watching two porcupines mate. The fact that Romy is cheating on her husband, theater director Jacob (played admirably by Antonio Banderas) is intriguing, but what she needs for sexual fulfillment is even more so.nnThe performances are strong all around, but the film belongs to Kidman whose brilliant portrayal is both brave and vulnerable. At 57, Kidman is doing the best work of her career on TV and the big screen.nnReijn's direction is intimate, raw and unyielding. She pulls no punches and lets scenes breathe until they become difficult to watch. The cinematography is harsh and unfiltered, making the film feel more realistic. I did have a problem with the bombastic score which, at times, threatened to overwhelm the visuals.nnAll in all 'Babygirl' is a fascinatingly frank and thought-provoking exploration of human sexuality that also turns the tables on workplace sexual politics. Be prepared as this film earns its R rating, but it's well worth the watch.",A,07/01/2025

Why would you follow the book until the last scene? How is the director so narcisitic to think that he should change the final scene?

Would be 15 > This 4-part TV mini series on The ITV Channel. The only negative is with the commercial TV channel showing the advertising breaks, in each of the four episodes. The Positive for me, is the drama itself. PLAYING NICE, was well acted, especially from James Norton (also Executive Producer), Niamh Algar, James McArdle and Jessica Brown Findlay. Well written by Grace Ofori-Attah and based on the book by J. P. Delaney (also Ex Producer) and well directed by Kate Hewill. Which is good to see more female directors getting involved, as they usually do great directing. A great example of that is Kathryn Bigelow, who directed the award winning for director, The Hurt Locker. Throughout this hard gripping drama about two pairs of parents getting each others baby mixed up at the births by mistake. Apart from death or serious illness, this must be a parents worst ever nightmare. The drama keeps you on edge, wondering what is going to happen next, what next can go wrong for one of the parents, how are we going to get through this, all the time, they are thinking why is this happening to us, are we going to be strong for each other? And how can we keep calm throughout this nightmare which seems to be getting worse, instead of getting better.

rw10244170,tt1723811,Shame (2011),"The second major film made by the director Steve McQueen is one of the best films made in the 2010's, that is greatly underrated.nnThe movie follows a relatively successful businessman named Brandon living in New York, who harbours a dark and shameful addiction. Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, is addicted to sex. He constantly needs to satisfy his need to orgasm, he hires prostitutes, picks up random women on bars or on the street, and when he's unsuccessful or isn't able to do that, he masturbates watching pornography or using his imagination. His addiction is so intense that he can't control it even while working, his mind wonders off when he sees an attractive coworker, constantly picturing having sex with them, he watches pornography in his shared office, even having his computer confiscated because he caught a virus downloading enormous quantities of porn, and to top all of that, he uses the office bathroom to masturbate.nnBrandon's shameful secret is surfacing and impacting his life, and he knows it's a matter of time until it brings him down. In the beginning of the film, Brandon stares down a beautiful woman on the train who seems interested and eye-flirts back. She then gets visibly uncomfortable and gets up showing her wedding ring, clearly feeling ashamed for engaging with another man that way, thus leaving the train in a hurry. Brandon follows her and loses her on the train station. He gets bothered because his lustful quest to fulfil his needs must continue.nnWhile his condition worsens, Brandon's sister Sissy shows up at his apartment, played by Carey Mulligan, the only person close to him, someone he constantly pushes away because he is incapable of having any other type of intimacy with people. Their relationship is truly dysfunctional, both having severe social and phycological problems in their own way. While Brandon managed to organize his life and having some financial success, Sissy doesn't have a home, money or a stable job. Sissy, while also having problems with relationships, is the antithesis of her brother, him being completely apathetic and Sissy needing a lot of emotional reassurance and support, clearly on the verge of a breakdown and dealing with a lot of loneliness. Brandon shut his emotions down completely, and Sissy is a slave to hers.nnWith his sister now living in his apartment, Brandon has another obstacle, not having the privacy to do what he needs to do, leading him to spiral downwards at a faster pace and to search for orgasms more destructively. Sissy has sex with Brandon's boss, a married man, she then proceeds to get attached to the point that she calls and texts him, showing how easily Sissy also has sex with other people, but differently to Brandon. She gets a look at his brother hidden facete, accidentally entering the bathroom while he´s masturbating and finding a cam girl website active on his computer. This leads him to try to take some initiative and get rid of his porn and sex toys collection.nnAfter a fight with his sister and Brandon showing his resentment towards her, he goes out. This is the most uncontrollable we've seen him, actively looking to cause problems and is in complete shackles to his addiction. Sissy calls Brandon all night pleading for him to return home, but he doesn't care. Brandon goes lower than he's ever been, having sex with multiple women and being so desperate that he even has oral sex with a man in a shady club. While he is on this rampage, we can hear the voice messages left by his sister, and that's when she says a vague sentence that completely explains them both without giving any type of concrete information on why that is, ""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place"".nnAfter a night of a sex binge, Brandon returns home when his train is evacuated due to a police investigation. This triggers something in him, suddenly remembering his sister who has a history of self-harm, and rushes home. He gets there only to find that Sissy had tried to end her life.nnThis is when we see Brandon's shame to its max. His addiction almost cost his sister's life, causing him to break down and recognizing how broken and troubled he truly is. The movie ends with Brandon returning home and meeting the same woman he saw on the metro in the beginning of the film, eying him down. This time we don't see lust in Brandon's eyes, we see shame.nnMichael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan gave an outstanding performance, giving these two characters their all. Steve McQueen's crude and uncensored approach took this film to its full potential, not being afraid to show nudity. This plus Fassbender's performance allowed the audience to delve into Brandon's psyche, see what was going on in his mind every minute of the day and while engaging in sexual intercourse/activities, and truly put us in his shoes. We can feel his anhedonia and lack of emotion, his inability to have a connection to other human beings. We can also feel how uncomfortable he felt around his sister and understand why he pushed her away even though she was the only person he truly cared for.nnHarry's Escott soundtrack emphasized Brandon's Spiral, the calm but unsettling track ""Brandon"" gradually strengthens dramatically, with a ticking noise always playing, hinting to his urge to orgasm gradually getting bigger. The track also gives off a feeling of ""impending doom"", something Brandon must've been feeling with his masquerade falling apart and his problem surfacing. When the track reaches its peak, it comes down in a similar pattern to the previous part, being slower but still dramatic. The track is constructed like Sisyphus curse, he pushes the boulder up the side of the mountain towards the peak, expecting and end, but the boulder falls of the other side and the cycle endures, exactly like Brandon's sex addiction. It´s never ending and it only gets worse.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244169,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"Few films in recent memory have left audiences as bewildered and disappointed as Nosferatu (2024). Billed as a bold reimagining of the classic 1922 horror masterpiece, the movie instead descends into a mire of poor creative choices, lackluster performances, and an utter disregard for its source material's legacy. While remakes often tread a fine line between homage and innovation, this film tragically fails to honor either, making it, in my opinion, one of the worst cinematic experiences in recent history.nnA Directionless VisionnnThe first glaring flaw lies in the film's direction. Helmed by a director who seemed more interested in imposing their artistic pretensions than crafting a coherent story, Nosferatu (2024) meanders without purpose. Gone is the haunting atmosphere of F. W. Murnau's silent original or even the eerie gravitas of Werner Herzog's 1979 reinterpretation. Instead, we are subjected to a visually incoherent and tonally inconsistent film that doesn't know whether it wants to be a psychological drama, a gothic horror, or a satirical commentary on modern anxieties. This indecisiveness creates a jarring viewing experience, leaving the audience more confused than captivated.nnSubpar PerformancesnnMuch of the blame for the film's failure must also be attributed to its cast. The titular Nosferatu, played by a prominent actor known for their roles in arthouse cinema, delivers a performance that is neither menacing nor tragic. Instead, the character feels like a caricature, devoid of the mystique or menace that made Max Schreck's original portrayal iconic. The supporting cast fares no better, with performances ranging from wooden to over-the-top. The lack of chemistry between the leads only compounds the problem, undermining any emotional stakes the film tries to establish.nnA Script That Betrays Its RootsnnThe screenplay is arguably the film's weakest element. Instead of crafting a compelling narrative, the script opts for a disjointed structure filled with pretentious dialogue and unnecessary subplots. The decision to modernize the story results in a loss of the timeless quality that defined the original. Moreover, the attempts at social commentary-whether on capitalism, technology, or the environment-feel ham-fisted and out of place, detracting from the core horror narrative. By trying to do too much, the script accomplishes nothing, leaving audiences alienated and uninvested.nnA Visual and Auditory MisfirennIf there's one aspect of Nosferatu that should have been its saving grace, it's the visual presentation. Unfortunately, the cinematography is a chaotic mess. The excessive use of CGI robs the film of any authentic atmosphere, making the gothic settings feel artificial and lifeless. The over-reliance on dim lighting and shaky camera work further detracts from the viewing experience, often making scenes difficult to follow.nnThe soundtrack, too, is a major disappointment. While the original Nosferatu used silence and an evocative score to heighten tension, this remake bombards viewers with a jarring mix of discordant orchestral pieces and inappropriate modern tracks. The result is a film that is not only visually unappealing but aurally grating as well.nnA Disservice to HorrornnPerhaps the most unforgivable sin of Nosferatu (2024) is its failure to be frightening. The original Nosferatu is remembered not just for its innovative filmmaking but for its ability to instill genuine dread. By contrast, this remake relies on cheap jump scares and predictable horror tropes, failing to create any sense of suspense or unease. The lack of originality in its scares makes it feel like a generic horror movie dressed in gothic trappings rather than a worthy successor to a genre-defining classic.nnConclusionnnIn its ambition to reinvent a cinematic legend, Nosferatu (2024) manages to accomplish the opposite: it diminishes its source material while failing to stand on its own merits. From its muddled direction and uninspired performances to its lackluster script and shoddy production values, every element of this film feels like a missed opportunity. While remakes always carry the risk of falling short of their predecessors, this film's failure is particularly egregious, given the rich material it had to draw from. For those seeking a memorable horror experience, Nosferatu (2024) is best avoided. Instead, revisit the classics that remind us why this tale of terror has endured for over a century.",A,07/01/2025
rw10244165,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Being Dutch, like the director Halina, I was very sceptical. A lot of movies coming from Dutch directors revolve around sex and often portrayed in a very explicit manner that doesn't always help the story.nnBabygirl is different. It is provocative and explicit, in a good way because it actually serves the storyline. There is a suspense to it, platfullness and eroticism that is quite unique for contemporary movies. It dares to be uncomfortable and challenge your beliefs on relationships, sex, power dynamics.nnI read a lot of people having a hard time with the fact that both characters don't have to face a lot of consequences from their 'bad' behaviour. I see this differently. At the end of the day they are both grownups and the movie is not about exploring the me-too theme at all, it is not ment to be moralistic and judge these characters.

Sport.nnNo bigger occasion than the South African World Cup in 1995. It really bridged communities together and showed people that blacks and whites can play together and win and succeed. It's a tragedy that there was only one black player in the starting line-up but what an achievement he made.nnI love the narrative. Matt Demon is superb as a relatively short version of Francois Pienaar! The funny quote from the bodyguard claiming that he's much shorter in real life than on the TV amplifies this.nnThere is a great 'Presidential Seal' by Morgan Freeman who just oozes absolute class and engraces the Nelson Mendella ethos so perfectly-well!nnI got goosebumps watching it as I remember hearing on the news how important Mandela's release was and how important Rugby was for him to secure a sense of release in his country which was previously impossible.nnSport is so important and this movie should be an educational film for all to see at schools. It's so important that people bridge differences and idealogies and racial segregation through the powerful medium of sports.nnClint Eastwood does an incredible job in amplifying this message and it's so very near perfect.

For the character development. As a psychologist I value the tricky part in human relations. For example in this movie there is a lot of room for speculation they don't spell it out for you.nnThe question we're all asking ourselves is who is going to be able to seduce our playboy? It turns out it will be a sick young girl. First thing about her is very obvious she is striking his ego because she's ""much younger"". The second thing is that he knew her mother, but he wasn't quite interested in her mother was he? Did he fumble her mother so now he gets a second chance with her daughter ? Maybe. But the thing that really seals the deal is that she's terminally sick. He tries to get rid of her but she tell him about his illness, he feel bad for her and practically stays with her because of compassion. That's the main reason he fell in love only with her, she's the only one with whom he has enough time for falling in love. AKA he wasn't able to scare her away. She had nothing else to be scared of in life.nnBut the important detail you're all missing is why would her grandmother allow this course of events? (My first that was ""omg what a progressive grandma"") And also many of you could ask yourselfs why even get in a relationship with this emotionally crippled jerk? And why did grandma allow that when she knows him well? The answer to that question is would it really be better to spend her last couple of months alone? ;( while going through a heartbreak?

rw10244090,tt0370263,AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004),"I'm watching all the Alien films in order. I feel this needs to be stated as normally I'd not be up for watching Alien vs. Predator, but I'm going in with an open mind. To be honest the Alien franchise already lost its way before this sidebar, so what's the harm in getting two classic 80s film monsters on the screen together. A team of archeologists are assembled in Antarctica by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen). He's the only holdover from what's gone before, the rest are brand new. We have Alexa (Sanaa Lathan), the guide on this expedition, Sebastian (Raoul Bova) the charismatic digger, Mark (Tommy Flanagan) the miserable muscle and Graeme (Ewan Bremner), the scientist goofball. Deep below the ice, they think they've found an ancient pyramid... possibly the first built, but by whom, or what. The set up is riddled with clunky cliched dialogue and it doesn't improve, but you're not watching this for its writing are you. Weyland is of course the company name from previous films and therefore assumed the bad guy, but not so. Here he's mostly just a rich old man, sick and looking for one last adventure to be remembered by. The pyramid when they reach it is like something from Indiana Jones, except instead of hieroglyphs of sphinx, there's Predator statues. Plus there's a defrosting caged Alien in the basement. A Queen! It's seems the Predators have woken the structure, as a team of them arrive from space. They gut the surplus cast and follow the human explorers into the icy depths. It's all a bit nuts, but I don't hate it. It's far-fetched, but not dumb, certainly not in terms of Alien films. It's a playful twist on the question of how the Egyptians built the pyramids conspiracy, it was aliens... according to this it was. The pyramid is a rights of passage colosseum for coming of age Predators, pitting themselves against the Aliens. It helps if you're familiar with Alien to follow this, it expects you to know that face-huggers are bad, although I guess there's little doubt of that. They get the Matrix bullet-time treatment here, which is pretty cool. Adele (Agathe de la Boulaye) gets the first honour of incubation, but doesn't do it nearly as well as John Hurt. I won't lie, the pyramid setting is a masterstroke. It reconfigures every ten minutes, with the walls grinding and shifting in ever twisting puzzles, separating those still alive into prey. Bang on the hour, the two species come face to face in a bonkers battle of brutal bloodlust. It's what you'd expect, but quite entertaining and it provides distraction for the few remaining humans to run for it. Shy on action it is not. A great film it is not, but compared to some other Alien films, it fairs better than you might think. It actually makes sense in a way and doesn't pretend to be anything but an action romp. This is my first time watching this spin off and I'm pleasantly surprised. My expectations were low and easily met, but freed of the weight of the standalone alone Alien films, this is quite good.",A,06/01/2025
rw10244087,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Dutch writer/director Halina Reijn's new feature 'Babygirl' is an exercise in boldness. The film is a fresh take on the age old story of self-discovery and self-destruction.nnIn the movie Nicole Kidman plays Romy, a highly successful CEO of a robotics company by day and sexual submissive by night. Despite having a picture-perfect home life with a loving husband and two daughters, Romy remains unseen and sexually unsatisfied until she meets an intern (Samuel) at her company who sees a side of her that's she's been hiding - her sexual identity.nnTwo older films come to mind when watching 'Babygirl' - Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful'. All three deal with infidelity and the razor's edge one walks when engaging in it. What stands out in 'Babygirl' is the feral, masochistic nature of Romy and Samuel's illicit encounters which leave Romy in equal parts exhilarated, scared, embarrassed and liberated.nnReijn's film presents an unvarnished view into shifting power differentials. The CEO has power over an intern just as much as a dom has power over a sub. Romy the titan gives in to the commands of Samuel the peon. Their initial encounters are awkward and uncomfortable both for them and the audience. It's like watching two porcupines mate. The fact that Romy is cheating on her husband, theater director Jacob (played admirably by Antonio Banderas) is intriguing, but what she needs for sexual fulfillment is even more so.nnThe performances are strong all around, but the film belongs to Kidman whose brilliant portrayal is both brave and vulnerable.

She pulls no punches and lets scenes breathe until they become difficult to watch. The cinematography is harsh and unfiltered, making the film feel more realistic. I did have a problem with the bombastic score which, at times, threatened to overwhelm the visuals.nnAll in all 'Babygirl' is a fascinatingly frank and thought-provoking exploration of human sexuality that also turns the tables on workplace sexual politics. Be prepared as this film earns its R rating, but it's well worth the watch.",A,06/01/2025
rw10244078,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"I didn't find this movie sexy or thrilling at all. I found it more scary and uncomfortable. There wasn't sexual tension between Nicole and Harrison. She just eventually gives into the idea of this guy having control over her after a few scenes of them being awkward and uncomfortable with each other. And that's mostly where I have a problem with this movie because it's supposedly liberating the sexual fantasies of women but instead it portrays abuse as kinky. It wasn't consensual and it wasn't spicy. It was just gross. She didn't want to take her clothes off at several points throughout the movie and to me that's a big fat no. I get that that can be a fantasy but it wasn't portrayed that way either. It was portrayed as a creep emotionally and sexually manipulating a middle aged woman. There wasn't even a power dynamic. He as the lesser person had more power than her and she was the CEO! It was like reading a wattpad novel with random and outlandish things occurring just to move the plot along. If the roles were reversed we would've gotten a hotass Bossman with power over his much younger female intern who's career could be ruined by the scandal but in this case the man still had the power to ruin her career and she was in a higher position than him. If that's how a woman's world works I don't want it.nnThankfully Nicole Kidman is such an amazing actress that it made up for most of the movie but it still ended so anti-climatically. This woman was scared to end a sexual relationship with her intern because he was blackmailing her, only for her to send him to Japan and finally get a backbone within the last 10 minutes of the movie. Like wtf is going on?! It had all the right elements but it was put together so poorly. I get she wanted to be told what to do like a dog and ""couldn't"" tell her husband but it seemed more like she was scared the whole time and that she wanted to be an actual dog while having sex.nnThis had abuse-me-while-I'm-super-uncomfortable-about-it vibes instead of a liberating sexual fantasy.",A,06/01/2025
rw10244053,tt5040012,Nosferatu (2024),"Most of the world is populated by dumb people. You can be certain while reading some of the reviews that fail to understand what Eggers did here. Light, shadows, every scene is a piece of art. Caravaggio, Van Gogh, you can see them while watching this movie. Should we talk about how Eggers deals from a psychological standpoint the thematic of rape? Or what about the women condition, repressed beings and thus lean to cultivate an evil inside that hollows them? An evil that drains them of their lives. Should we talk about the religious thematic? A redemption for women, given the fact that Ellen dies to redeem humanity of its sins.nnBut this is just peanuts comparing to the magnificence of Eggers movie.

rw10243984,tt0119282,Hercules (1997),"I typically don't write reviews about movies I initially watched as a child. But I have done so recently for some TV series I have watched, & I wrote a review for Disney's 'Hercules' elsewhere two summers ago. So, I thought I would share it here with IMDb.nnI've always had a good memory for remembering details of movies many years later. But seeing this one again, as with my past experiences of revisiting childhood movies & such, I again notice new things & see things differently. I enjoy the adult humour hidden in plain sight. The part where Herc peeks around to glance at Nessus' genitals had me pause it to stop laughing! The part where Pain & Panic play kids under the boulder had an interesting line: ""Somebody call I. X. I. I.!"" It took me a bit to figure out that reference!nnIt's not all comedy though - it's also epic. The integration of CGI into the traditional animation, although it hasn't aged as well, is still kind of awesome, namely during the Hydra scene. I still get a tingle down my back at the bit where Hercules, mounted atop Pegasus, looks in horror upon the multi-headed beast appearing out of the darkness.nnEven though I knew how the ending goes, I was about ready to bawl at the part where Meg dies. Surprising that that scene strikes me at age 32, but had no effect on me at age 8. Not surprising, however, is how much I like Meg's hairstyle & her armpit-blended bosoms.nnOverall, my favourite character is still Hades. His persona as an overcaffeinated salesman caught between an anger management problem & a suppressed desire to pursue a career in stand-up comedy is inimitable & unforgettable. Disney could have dedicated an entire TV spinoff to just Hades' life after quitting the Underworld.nnOther things I also notice now include how much resemblance Panic's persona bears to that of Harold Green on [link=tt0101177], the facial resemblance of the giant snake Herc wrangles to Joanna in [link=tt0100477], & how you could feed a village of starving children with Zeus' pecs.nnEven at the age of eight or nine, I was aware though that this movie was less a depiction of Greek mythology than it was a parody of American life in the 90s. For a rather refreshed, even contemporary (at the time) take on what was intended to be another Disney classic, it hasn't aged too badly & still has a great feel to it.",A,06/01/2025

There isn't anything redeeming about this film. This could have been a decent film with the correct military consultant and director. For the military historian this is a nightmare. The uniforms are wrong, the weapons are wrong, even the boonie slang and radio talk are incorrect. This one should have been left on the shelf until it could have had the right budget. There are many other Vietnam era films that are MUCH better. Do yourself a favor and go watch one of them instead.",A,06/01/2025

In the 5 minutes that I watched, it seemed so rushed and casual that I thought this must be a snuff film or something along the lines of making fun of this specific genre. Luckily, I checked out the IMDB score and reviews.... It saved me a ton of time and disappointment. The storyline seems completely lacking and there is no character or story development at all.nnApparently, I have to write more. This movie just isn't worth the amount of characters for the minimum review size. Comparing all exorcism movies to the OG, is ridiculous.

The Silmarrilion and other divergent works serve as the source material for this rather unwieldy show. BUT, don't be deterred by the first season's efforts to bring the characters and plotlines into focus... it's quite a task. The visuals are breathtaking throughout, but the show really takes off in season 2, after all the setup is in place.

Landman was really disappointing (we quit after 3 episodes). Billy Bob was a ridiculously tough old man in every scene and the portrayal of his daughter and ex-wife are sexist and shallow. The father-daughter relationship feels creepy. The series display a very odd view of women which surprises us because all other Sheridan shows have had strong, independent female characters. It's impressive how many series Taylor Sheridan has produced in just a few years, but this show may be the evidence that he should slow down and focus on quality rather than quantity.",A,06/01/2025

Characters are liberatingly far away from the normal «all good» or «all evil» stereotypes. Plot is sufficiently complex to require your full attention, and if you are like me you will feel the suspense and not move much from your chair. Also void of endless unrealistic fighting scenes and car chases, which is a big plus. When I saw that the movie had only 6.8 on Imdb I was really surprised, as I think it deserves an 8 or 9 and I consider myself to be really picky and demanding.

After the initial shock she tries to understand what is happening, The children finding out react badly, very negatively.

And there's zero suspense to the husband finding out, and coworkers finding out, that's inevitable in any movie. And in the end they all live happily ever after with zero repercussions.

rw10243857,tt23782584,Nr. 24 (2024),"True story about Gunnar Sønsteby, whom was an important figure in the Norwegian resistance - located in Oslo - during the Nazi occupation of Norway.nnA combination of the old ""Gunnar Sønsteby"" (an actor) and the WW2 Gunnar, it is a back-and-forth between the two of them. Fortunately, this back-and-forth isn't too disturbing. I would have preferred a more chronological movie, whereby only attention is put to the WW2 period.nnThe acting is very good. Superb however are the scenes! All looks exactly as you would expect things to look like during WW2.nnThe storyline - apart from being fragmented - would have benefitted greatly from a clear antagonist, ""the bad guy"". This to give the viewer a better idea on how the Nazi's were trying to identify and locate the resistance members. Because that was something that clearly happened.nnTaking into account all of the above, I think that this movie deserves a score of 7.3/10, making it a 7-star IMDb movie.nnI personally think that this movie is best watched after you first see the movie ""Max Manus - Man of War"" (2008), which features the same resistance group. That movie gives a better view on the functioning - and people - in that resistance group. Whereby Gunnar Sønsteby seems to be a leader of the group, it was actually Max Manus - and his close friends - that committed the operational side of the sabotages. In the Max Manus movie, you will see several of the famous sabotages like e.g. The sinking of the Donau war-ship.nnAs a final remark, I want to comment on the original movie description that accompanies ""Nr. 24"". It reads that Sønsteby is the greatest war hero of Norway. To say this, does injustice to all people that died during work for the army, the resistance or from Nazi torture or execution. This whilst fighting for Norway's freedom. It would be more fair to name all the people that risked, or even gave their life, a hero. It should not be about whom is able to survive the war - and live the longest - to be able to claim a title like ""greatest hero"".",A,06/01/2025

Inevitably he got shot again. I was expecting to see him awaken from that too.nnThis is just one example of incredulous plot lines. There were so many others. I won't recount them here.nnBottom line, this film is not worth the effort.

Go to the drawing board yourself and try come up with a plot for this topic.nnHave a young man kill a man that is shown to be a douche bag (only reason he ever gets so much screen time) and then have him get executed in a cold way. Oh, and also humanise the living crap out of the killer for the second half of the movie, have him talk about his family.nnI liked the part where he killed the man because he was partly responsible for the murder of his sister some time ago. But here is the catch: why? This correlation is never explained so I'm just supposed to give the movie a benefit of the doubt that there was some smart psychological explanation behind this.nnAlso for a topic like this, the movie never 'argues' its ideas, it just sets up the plot so 'meticulously' to make us feel for the character. What if the cab driver was a real kind man, like we saw him work some hard hours to feed his family, and then he gets killed, now that would be a harder pill to swallow AND a more convincing one. Because in retrospect this movie is so obvious. I don't even have some strong opinion on the topic of capital punishment so I'm not biased to dislike this movie, but it's approach feels so 'first draft' that I can't really appreciate this movie.nnCinematography: somehow the movie was very atmospheric from the get go, but God. I felt like I was watching the movie through a peephole the entire duration because the amounts of vignettes and shadow gradients added in the post production.nnThe positive note for this film is how the scenes are directed, yes, I'd agree those murders were impactful and the coldness of both murders got through very well. It was fantastic. The acting from everyone is superb.nnThe movie was paced well and was fun to watch as well, the intensity was well maintained through the first half of the movie.

rw10243426,tt0120663,Eyes Wide Shut (1999),"What was the real life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman thinking before signing a movie about cheating on each other!nnNow I know this movie is supposedly filled with a lot of symbolism and hidden details and themes like secret pedophile clubs, but I believe it is not possible to figure all that out in the first watch; it will take at least 3-4 rewatches. So we will not talk about that stuff. But even if you are making a detailed movie like that, I believe it is important that the movie in its first watch itself is enjoyable enough. I am not saying that it should be like a Michael Bay movie (not a fan of that stuff personally). I like slow burners, but this movie, in its first watch at least, gives you only a tan rather than a burn, in all its slowness.nnAs was the scenario with Kubrick's previous movie Full Metal Jacket, the first 40 minutes are brilliant and very entertaining. Your eyes remain glued to the screen but then a new thread in the story opens and is not able to maintain the same tension. It was Vietnam war in FMJ and the secret society in this one. Every emotion till the prostitute scene was highly palpable but the story goes on a different tangent when Tom goes to the orgy. It somewhat deviates from what I thought would be the central theme. Then the ending was always predictable.nnThe cinematography, music and detailing were top notch as you expect from a Kubrick movie. He is a true master of cinema. The editing was also nice except the overuse of the transition in which one shot fades into another. Kubrick wants his actors to be over-expressive and I agree with him that it makes the movie more interesting, until, it doesn't, which was the case with the acting of Nicole Kidman and Marie Richardson. Nicole Kidman was especially painful to watch. She utters the dialogue so slowly that you feel like sleeping. Tom Cruise did a pretty good job.nnScript also had its flaws; for example, Tom tries to find Nick's address and the first girl she stumbles across, knows it; the receptionist of the hotel doesn't even remember Amanda's name which is weird because I don't think people dying in your hotel is a daily affair; and above all, Tom Cruise throwing his medical license as an FBI badge to get access to any place possible. The lead characters also needed some more depth for a 2hr39min movie.nnIt will probably grow over me when I watch it again, but for now it feels one of the weaker ones of Kubrick.",A,06/01/2025

rw10243262,tt19299920,"""Black Money"" (2025)","### Black Money: The Most Disappointing Work I've Seen from Raihan RafinnI had high hopes when I started watching *Black Money*, directed by Raihan Rafi. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed his previous works, especially the commercial hit *Toofan*, I was expecting another remarkable project. Unfortunately, what I experienced was nothing short of disappointing. Throughout the series, I felt let down by almost every aspect - from the overacting to the poor technical quality and a storyline that failed to captivate.nn#### A Story That Goes NowherennThe biggest flaw of *Black Money* is its weak and uninspired story. The premise had potential, but it felt as though no effort was put into fleshing it out. Instead of a gripping narrative, the series meandered aimlessly with predictable twists and clichéd moments. I kept waiting for something engaging to happen, but it never did. The lack of depth in the story made it hard to care about the characters or their struggles.nn#### Overacting from Talented ActorsnnOne of the most frustrating aspects of this series was the performances. I've seen the cast excel in their past roles, which made it even more disappointing to watch them overact to the point where it became unbearable. The dialogue delivery felt forced, and the characters were exaggerated to the extent that they seemed cartoonish. I couldn't connect with any of them because their performances lacked the authenticity and subtlety needed to make them believable.nn#### Technical FailuresnnThe technical quality of *Black Money* was shockingly bad. From the very first episode, the poor cinematography was evident. The lighting was flat, and the camera work lacked creativity, making the visuals look dull and lifeless. The editing choices were equally questionable, with abrupt transitions that disrupted the flow of the story. Even the sound design was underwhelming, failing to add the tension or atmosphere that a series like this desperately needed.nn#### Direction That Lacked PassionnnWhat puzzled me the most was Raihan Rafi's direction. In *Toofan*, he proved his ability to craft engaging stories and bring out the best in his cast and crew. But in *Black Money*, it felt like he wasn't fully invested in the project. The direction was inconsistent, and the series lacked a clear vision. The pacing was all over the place, and there was no sense of cohesion between the scenes. It's hard to believe this is the same director who delivered such brilliant work in the past.nn#### Wasted PotentialnnWhat makes *Black Money* even more disappointing is the fact that it had so much potential. A story centered around corruption and crime involving money could have been gripping and thought-provoking. But instead of diving deep into these themes, the series scratched the surface and ended up being a shallow, poorly executed mess.nn#### Final ThoughtsnnWatching *Black Money* felt like a chore. The overacting, weak story, poor technical quality, and uninspired direction made it one of the worst viewing experiences I've had in a long time. As a fan of Raihan Rafi, I hope this is just a temporary misstep and not an indication of his future work.nnIf you're considering watching *Black Money*, I'd recommend saving your time and revisiting Rafi's earlier works instead. This series is a reminder that even the best directors can sometimes falter, but I'm hopeful that Raihan Rafi will bounce back stronger in his next project.",A,06/01/2025

rw10243218,tt10171472,Goodrich (2024),"I watched this movie on the plane because of the cast. Michael Keaton and Mila Kunis were both great in this movie, but the writing was very cringe and left me with a very uncomfortable and almost angry feeling about the demonization of the title character.nnFirst of all, the whole movie is centered around what a deadbeat father and husband he is, attributed to his love of art and his art gallery small business he had owned for decades. The breakup of his first marriage is not explained much but he and his ex maintain a civil relationship and an almost friendship. His relationship with his 36 year old daughter to me is quite strong. In fact I have known many friends in the same situation as having a father who starts over with a younger wife and has young children in their late forties and in real life the relationship with the older children is rarely this caring. He has meaningful conversations with her and is quite involved in her pregnancy. He is truly ecstatic about being a grandfather. However the movie simply trashes him because he often calls the older daughter by the youngest daughter's name, and for being more involved in the younger children's lives than he was with the older daughter. Firstly, most parents mix up their kids names. My mom would sometimes shout all four of our names before she got it right. It's not grounds for bad parenting. It's just a thing overworked parents do. Secondly, he was most certainly NOT more involved with the younger children's lives, and only started attending parent teacher conferences when his wife abandoned the family without notice leaving him no choice. So the daughters angry perceptions of him seemed were more reflections of her inability to appreciate her father than of his failings. She became extremely angry at him when he failed to drive her to a doctor appointment. This anger was justified however at the current state his life was in (wife left him, business about to shut, parenting 2 young kids alone) I believe he deserved more grace than he was given. Also she was in a stronger place in her life than he was so it was foolish of her to rely on him. She had no kids, was 36, no job, and was married to a successful doctor. Taking uber to a doctor appointment isn't the end of the world. She also didn't seem to call or text. Odd communication.nnNow for the wife. The new younger wife is placed on a ridiculous pedestal she does not deserve. Without warning she leaves her two kids alone with a workaholic father because she is a junkie addicted to pills (apparently uppers and downers). At no moment is she held accountable for her own addiction, and in fact, her husband is blamed because he works too much. He is criticized hard for not recognizing she had a problem, however on all accounts she is an amazing super mom who cooks expert gluten free meals and never takes the kids late to school. She is celebrated for leaving the family because she is ""getting help."" I found the way she left to be truly cruel and the dad would have an excellent case for custody of the kids vs the selfish drug addicted abandoner. When she shows up unannounced and demands to talk about why she is divorcing him, she is taking time away from when he is supposed to be taking his adult daughter to the doctor. She has no respect for his time, doesn't ask if it's a good time and just barges in unannounced. Also I am not sure why his working so much was such a problem for her, since she doesn't eat an income. The division of labor in the household seemednlike the common American trad wife set up and there was no indication she had expressed desire to find a job or do other things.nnIn summary- this movie was a major bummer with a really strange perspective and I wish I hadn't seen it.",A,06/01/2025

His attitude towards everyone is really rude and when they entered the Majdanek I was a little stressed not by the place but by the thought that Benji will comment again. Of course instead of making a scene in concentration camp they decided for a CEMETERY as a perfect place for that. Walking over the graves, just arguing around it. I felt bad for the tour guide then as he was literally preserving the history of those who were laid there to rest, and Benji jumped at him saying ""THEY were people not some numbers"".

She's turning 18 in the tiny picturesque community in Muskoka, Ontario, where her family has farmed cranberries for generations. She has a janky little motorboat, two best friends and a massive crush on the girl behind the counter at the local coffee shop. And she's looking forward to heading to Toronto in a few short weeks to start the next chapter of her life. Sounds familiar. You might even relate. But ""My Old Ass,"" written and directed by Megan Park, does not go in expected coming-of-age directions. It's as much about reframing middle-aged regrets as it is a story about youth, love and possibility - and thus the emotional heft it wields is two-pronged.nnElliott belongs to a newish and very welcome variety of teen girl movie protagonist. For decades, these characters were mostly siloed into vapid types, the better for us, I guess, to ""understand"" them: Goths, cheerleaders, ditzes, bookish wallflowers, cool girls, bullies. Elliott, on the other hand, is funny, capable and comfortable in her own skin. She can drive a tractor and steer a boat, and also forgets to show up for her own birthday dinner with her family. She is very thoroughly 18, with as strong a sense of self as you can really have at that age, while also being kind of a jerk at times to her parents and brothers. She loves them.

He was shown very fun loving person, you will love his character initially in love story but after some time you will expect some amount of seriousness in his character. Even in emotional scenes his character didn't showed seriousness.nnNandani- She was daughter of teacher of sam. She was confused between her husband and lover. At some point you will either find her character illogical or you will hate her.nnVanraj- He was husband of nandani. He was shown very simple who can't sing but was very honest & a responsible husband. His character needed more attention especially his scenes with nandani.nnPundit darbar- He was father of nandani & a talented singer but was bounded by conservative thoughts & ideologies although he loved his daughter a lot.nnRest all characters just supported the story, not much focus was paid on them.nnPerformances- Above averagenSalman khan- He did a fabulous work as a lover. But lack of seriousness was a major drawback of his performance.

The character of vanraj taught us that you can win love even by remaining simple & grounded.

If you have lot of time then you can see this simple predictable love story of exceptional songs & lavish vintage sets. The film is contradictory to it's title where the girl gives her heart another time inspite giving before to another man.

rw10243051,tt18559464,My Old Ass (2024),"My Old Ass is a genre-bending coming-of-age story with a wild twist, directed by Megan Park. The film follows free-spirited Elliott (Maisy Stella), a teenager whose life takes an unexpected turn during her 18th birthday when a mushroom trip introduces her to a time-traveling version of herself-her 39-year-old ""old ass"" (played by Aubrey Plaza). What begins as a surreal encounter quickly turns into a hilarious and heartfelt journey as Elliott's older self starts dishing out unsolicited advice on love, family, and life choices, forcing young Elliott to rethink everything she thought she knew.nnPark, following up on her strong debut The Fallout, dives into absurdity with this sophomore film, blending stoner comedy, sci-fi, and emotional drama with just the right touch of Hallmark-style sentimentality. The small-town lake setting of Muskoka, Ontario, adds a postcard-perfect charm to the otherwise wacky narrative, creating a warm contrast to the film's offbeat humor and time-bending antics.nnMaisy Stella's portrayal of young Elliott captures the essence of teenage uncertainty and angst, while Aubrey Plaza's older Elliott injects the story with her signature dry wit and offbeat energy. Plaza's performance, which could have easily overshadowed the film, instead complements Elliott's more earnest journey, striking a balance between humor and heartfelt moments. Together, the two create a compelling dynamic that elevates the film beyond its quirky premise.nnWhile the film's surreal elements could have derailed into chaos, Park masterfully keeps things grounded, using the bizarre premise to enhance the emotional stakes. Elliott's internal struggles about growing up, love, and identity hit hard, and even though the film dips into melodrama, it maintains a level of authenticity that resonates.nnThe supporting cast adds depth to the film, though some characters feel underutilized. Elliott's best friend Ro (Kerrice Brooks) is unfortunately relegated to the role of a sounding board, and her story arc feels a bit underdeveloped. Percy Hynes White's charming portrayal of Chad, Elliott's summer love interest, brings added tension as Elliott's older self warns her against pursuing him, creating a tug-of-war between her past and future desires.nnDespite a few familiar tropes, My Old Ass delivers a delightful mix of laughs, emotional beats, and chaotic energy. The film's exploration of identity, time, and the messy transition into adulthood strikes a chord, and Park's playful mixing of genres keeps the ride enjoyable, even if not every element perfectly lands.nnWith its mix of sci-fi weirdness, heartfelt moments, and stoner comedy, My Old Ass will appeal to those looking for something unconventional but relatable. It's a sweet, funny, and sometimes nostalgic trip that punches with emotional force, often without you even realizing it. Though the film wraps up a little too quickly, it leaves a lasting impression-a fun, surprising, and emotional journey into the complicated world of growing up.l like it.",A,06/01/2025

Jumanji but with the horror turned all the way up.nnWhat Game of Death fails to do where they succeeded though, is to make the GAME an actual GAME.nnIn the others characters die because they get killed off in the game, or they refuse to bow to the very varied and interesting whims of the game they are playing, which gives them tailored 'missions' relating to their personalities and connections to other players.nnHere the game is a glorified countdown timer that takes a bit of their blood at the beginning.nnThat's it, the game is just 'kill people or your head will explode' which isn't really a game at all when you think about it.nnAnyway, outside of the main plot device being a bust, the characters are all terminally unlikable, there is a weird and unnecessary incest subplot, and it feels like the director has just picked up a copy of 'Babies first Camera Shots' and wants to try ALL of them.nnGame of Death's biggest sin though, is that it's just boring. Boring characters, boring use of a good concept, boring kills, boring conclusion and a boring post-scene that completely rips off Jumanji to set up a sequel that will never EVER be made.nnOh, and the WORST speech I think I've ever heard in all of recorded cinematography, where the final girl goes on for a good 3 minutes about how she's choosing life and all this nonsense, mere moments after deciding her life wasn't more important than other innocent people's lives.nnYou can tell the writer really thought they'd hit a home run with this hokey, bloated diatribe, but it just comes across an cringey and... you guessed it; boring.nnThe gore effects on the head explosions ARE good, but then there's a scene where a guy has been cut in two and the effects there look like a primary school painting.

rw10243031,tt14260836,Better Man (2024),"There are way more better ways to execute an artist biopic movie than this one. I cannot take this movie seriously and I can't even take the positive 10/10 reviews seriously because they really seem AI generated, which further raises my suspicion on the rating of this movie.nnI get the innovative idea of putting a CGI monkey as a main character and expecting the audience to develop a connection with it but in this case it seems it just doesn't work. (It was more laughable and most parts I couldn't really take seriously). The humour is really stale and way more sexually oriented than I expected. It was unfunny and in some parts just plain weird, considering the main character is a monkey.nnThis movie doesn't seem genuine and I see it as a way for Robbie Williams to further feed his ego. His hungry ego is clearly the main template for this movie. It is so selfish to the point where I don't believe some of these things ever happened and he just made it up to seem as the bigger man. The movie is solely focused on him being the victim and choosing extreme self-destructive behavior, which is shown way too often, despite getting everything he ever wanted. In some scenes this is just too obvious and it starts to get obnoxious really quickly, at moments even tiring considering that this movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 15 minutes. Some scenes really got me scratching my head and I couldn't understand how you even come up with that and be satisfied with the outcome (Knebworth performance), and some scenes really seem added additionally to complete the plot.nnThe ending, although I found it okay, left some things to be desired and it felt a little bit worn out and boring.nnThe only reason I'm not giving this movie a 1* review is because of the animation team, which did a great job, especially in certain scene transitions.nnAs mentioned, the movie just serves as an ego boost for Robbie and lacks depth, which is the reason why I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take it seriously.",A,06/01/2025

Yes, Lashana's character is strong and well writen, but only in the beginning and her motives at the end remain vague. The same goes for the protagonist: Through the course of the first season, one really starts to wonder, how he can be deemed to be the best at what he's doing. The Set is okay most of the times, so is the camera, but the Cutting for example remains a mystery to me. Sometimes scenes are ended abruptly.

rw10242939,tt11126994,"""Arcane"" (2021)","'Into the Spiderverse' (2018) caused a paradigm shift in animation, best described in Arcane's context as a 'Glorious Evolution'nn2010 and forward, animation geared toward more realism, making selling points out of realistic hair, clothing and even water and sand physics. Meanwhile, 2D animation adhered mostly to it's tried and tested aesthetic, with CGI being used to enhance instead of making it 3D. This holds true for other forms of animation - like stop motion.nnThe Spiderverse films broke tradition and combined these elements. The goal is to make it look like hand drawn pages of a comic book come to life. The outcome was distinct. The 2D and CGI elements blended seamlessly and created its own style. It proved that 'visually stunning' is not how close you can get to mimic reality, but how beautiful the outcome despite mixing mediums.nnTo be fair, Some Spiderverse scenes also look like real skylines and streets. Proving that realism can still be conjured even if it isn't entirely 3D. The industry followed and this 'style' popped more often.nnArcane essentially perfected this. It's 3D but everything is made to look like a painting - because they are ACTUALLY painted in production. Special effects, explosions and gases, more often than not, take a 2D-cartoon form, juxtaposing the 3D characters. The show is one of the best-looking animated series to date - with every frame literally a painting.nnFortiche Production, the French studio responsible for animating the series is a frequent collaborator of Riot - the game company. If it was not yet known, Arcane is based on 'League of Legends', one of the most popular video games, which is also a world-renowned E-Sport. While Austin is more familiar with League's main rival, Dota 2, there is no denying League's reach and popularity. Their World Championships are as big as sports events, and Fortiche are usually commissioned to make music videos for promotion. This is also why each episode of Arcane itself contains at least one dialogue-less sequence that flows like a music video. Musicians featured are not to be taken lightly as well, because Grammy-winning bands abound the soundtrack - namely Linkin Park, Imagine Dragons and Twenty One Pilots.nnFast forward to 2024 - Arcane's overwhelming success translated to it becoming the new canon lore instead of being a spin-off game companion. While this move gained mixed reception from the actual gamers, it is further proof that the series is just on another level. It drew a global audience, with some having no idea that it's based on a game.nnArcane's success is not only from its beautiful animation, or billboard nominated OSTs. Its narrative goes far beyond what is expected of a video game tie-in. The initial set up of pitting the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed undercity of Zaun has already enough allegorical power to draw audiences, but the main focus on tragic characters from both sides and the details surrounding their motivations, permits them to stay till the very end.nnArcane circulates its main themes on love and connection, parenthood and family, violence and vengeance, transformation and forgiveness. The series boasts accolades such as a 100% critic score for Rotten Tomatoes and the second season being the only tv series in IMDB with each episode scoring 9 and above as of this writing. It's also a recipient of a Primetime Emmy Award and dominated the Annie Awards for television series for its first season in 2022.nnHowever, despite season two having a better overall rating than season one, there's a fair share of criticisms thrown upon it that started when claims circulated online that it's 5-season plan was shortened due to the costs bloating to 250 million dollars - prompting writers and artists to shorten sequences and plotlines. This remains unproven, and can be a premature miscommunication of the actual announcement that the series will expand into other regions and stories.nnEven then, for us, everything set in the first season all fell into place as intended. Maybe people just wanted more of Arcane and we could not blame them. Nevertheless ""there is beauty in imperfections"" cliché as it may be, it more or less applies to Arcane whether or not season two did have its issues.nnThe character Victor further expresses through dialogue that ""there is no price to perfection...only an end to pursuit"" Whatever it's circumstances, Arcane currently has no equal. A true triumph of a show.",A,06/01/2025

rw10242885,tt18548186,Pig Killer (2022),"As a Canadian who saw this all unfold on the news and the documentaries that followed, and a true horror movie fan of 30+ years, I can't say anything good about this movie! Let me be blunt, there was NO 'comedy' in the real-life story of Robert 'Willie' Pickton, or his 20-some known victims (or.49 according to Pickton's confessions). I'm sure the victim's families would agree with that statement and I hope they never see this movie. This movie makes a farce out of the murders and how they were carried out. In my opinion, I find Jake Busey to be a mediocre actor at best, not to mention he looks nothing like Picton, so I did not like him in this role at all. If your lead actor falls short, the rest of the cast is simply there to pick up the pieces.nnThere were no 'pretty people' in Picton's life or among his victim's, everything was a depraved, filthy, slimy, drug and alcohol fueled nightmare, from his pig farm, to Hastings street in Vancouver and the prostitutes he murdered. Picton lived his life on the dark seedy underside of the actual dark seedy underside. You can't use the term 'based on true events' and miss ALL the true events, or downplay the most horrid of them. If properly told, depicted and acted, Picton's story would make Leatherface look like an overgrown man-child running amuck with an electric carving knife. Picton picked up prostitutes, drifters and junkies, he had sex with them, drugged them, tortured some of them, enslaved some of them, killed, bled out, skinned and dismembered them and fed almost all of them to his pigs to cover up his crimes. Somebody should have fed the film/footage of this movie to pigs, to cover up how awful it is.",A,06/01/2025

The execution as a generative work using extremely optimized visual media makes every minute gesture resound. The use of a decentralized blockchain (a censorship-resistant infrastructure) also lends force to the subversion of censorship -- a central theme for this film's topic, which has been widely censored and suppressed by mainstream media as well as social media algorithms and public discourse in general.nnIndeed, Chainleft makes every element of the film's medium speak -- the technical, the aesthetic, the conceptual, the social, the aural. It interconnects all of these through its execution like a fractal seed.nnThis is a film that illuminates not only a dire humanitarian issue, but also offers structures that can serve to change the underlying conditions that have allowed it to unfold. In its release mechanism, it wields the financialized nature of blockchains to accrue donations for Gazan relief. It connects with a broad group of people who would otherwise be ambivalent or even resistant to supporting this cause by using its mastery of a technology they are engaged/invested in to capture their interest and respect, and it then channels this toward its activist aim.nnThis execution, however, would not matter unless it communicates its message experientaly in film, and it does this with a poetic and resoundingly heartfelt force.",A,06/01/2025

The ONLY reason I watched after that episode was when I saw the actor was actually 28 years old.

X Files but ...with a Catholic and Supernatural twist.nnNETWORK: Wow... We're liking it, we're liking it. Right everybody? Go on.nnCREATORS: Well, we're thinking an African American priest, a POC tech guy and a female psychologist.nnNETWORK: Yep, that should work in today's climate. Our peers will like that. And with X Files, there seemed to be a kind of monster of the week. Same idea here, we're guessing.nnCREATORS: Yep. But the thing is, there will be no explanation or follow-through on any of the monsters or events. They are assessors, these three and they assess and then the next assessment comes and... like you know, poof, goldfish memory... onto the next.nnNETWORK: Okay... so to get this straight, they, the monsters, the creepy stuff... just appear and go away and nothing much changes?nnCREATORS: Exactly.nnNETWORK: Well, you have to give the audience something. Something. You know, with the X Files there was a feeling of ... what's the word... (snapping their fingers, pointing to an intern. The Intern cautiously says 'closure') Yes, that's it! Thanks, Chloe. Closure! (The intern reminds them her name is Madison. They wave her off.)nnCREATORS: Nope. We'll just leave some episode endings hanging. Nothing... no closure or really any sense of moral. There will be one episode with a jinn and his head is on fire and Kristen will be playing with the idea of having a one-night stand and then the next episode, reset. Like, The Simpsons. And plot threads as well, we'll abandon a few of those, too.nnNETWORK EXEC (holding an overview): It says here you plan one episode where a wife turns to salt. To salt? Like in the Bible. Oh, Catholic thingie... got it! And her husband. What happens to him after this?nnCREATORS shrug: Who knows? Nothing?nnNETWORK EXECS (sharing looks): Well, that might be... okay...um tell us about these characters.nnCREATORS: You know how in some shows where a character can be honest and foster communcation and solve their problems and resolve misunderstandings but they don't and it annoys the audience and it just goes on and on. We're going to do that a lot. We mean, a lot, a lot.nnNETWORK: Frustrating the audience for the sake of drama, okay, good for binge watching should it get streamed. It worked for Downton Abbey.nnCREATORS: For instance, the female character, her name is Kristen and her mother is single and dating Kristen's arch enemy. This arch enemy is like Hannibal Lector but if he looked like a nerd. Well, he threatens Kristen and her family and the mother starts dating him. All Kristen has to do is tell her mother: this man has threatened your granddaughters' lives but nope... she doesn't and it goes on, unrealistically for a long time. That's the basic idea.nnNETWORK: And these granddaughters? What's their deal?nnCREATORS: Four of them. They will be adorable but constantly talking over each other, screaming and it will be really annoying but we won't do anything about it. Because, you know...nnNETWORK: And Kristen, what's her background?nnCREATORS: She was a mountain climber and a doctor. And she is in her early thirties. Maybe forties. She is slim and pretty. That's important and she's intelligent. And she's not a man.nnNETWORK: Okay, well... a mountain climber, now a doctor. When did she get time to climb mountains, become a doctor and have four kids?nnCREATORS (blinking, silence).nnNETWORK: And the other two characters. This POC tech guy.nnCREATORS: He will be the skeptic and comic relief, a non-believer and then he will believe. Like Kristen, a demon will visit him. Oh yeah, Kristen has this demon named George that appears in her dreams.nnNETWORK: Does she talk to the priest about this demon?nnCREATORS: They don't really talk about much stuff that is supernatural in their lives. Again, no one is honest with each other. Like, Kristen, this one bad guy - a non-POC - is threatening her family and the police, of course, are on the bad guy's side... because... plot says so and Kristen, instead of getting help, she unalives him.nnNETWORK: I am sure you can say the 'k' word here.nnCREATORS: Anyway... and then she has this dark side.nnNETWORK: Where did that come from?nnCREATORS: Unclear. Maybe it's the arch nemesis. We're still trying to figure stuff out. The nerd has power and maybe he doesn't. We'll keep audiences guessing. Again, drama. Another example: the one associate points out she has blood on her leg and instead of saying, 'oh I cut myself shaing', which most normal and careful people hiding a crime would do,but nope, Kristen gives him enough to suspect her... because... you know... plot.nnNETWORK: For a woman who climbed mountains, you think she would be more careful. Okay, and this priest? Tell us about him.nnCREATORS: We're going to make sure his stories involve politically correct subjects.nnNETWORK: Great, we need that. We need to divide our viewership even more.nnCREATOR: And he is super attractive. Like an American Idris Alba.nnNETWORK: As long as the non-POC and straight men look less intelligent, all the better. And with the police, make sure the detectives are women and the one male detective is incompetent and shown sleeping on the job. We need that.nnCREATORS: We got you covered. But all this won't be so on the nose like in our show The Good Fight. We will make it subtle so certain people don't turn it off.nnNETWORK: As long as a certain bunch of people not on our political side feel uncomfortable, we're happy. Anything else?nnCREATORS: Did we mention the granddaughters are annoying and we won't do anything about it?nnNETWORK: Yep. And that characters refuse to be honest with each other for the sake of drama. And with our casting, Rotten Tomatoes will sure give us a Fresh Score. Let's get thing going.

rw10242773,tt12810074,Nightbitch (2024),"This is yet another movie that tries to give metaphorical meaning to turning into an animal. I mean, it probably was that all along, but in this day and age, when you see there is a movie about someone turning into an animal and tagged horror and body horror you expect some were-action. But no, other than some slightly nauseating scenes of body hair, which are still less horrible than the birth scene at the end, this film is all about motherhood.nnAnd I liked that it portrayed the good and the bad, the frustrations of and the unfairness towards women and pregnant women in particular, but also how their whining sometimes crosses the mark into self-absorption an bitchy preaching. Meanwhile the working dad, ""mansplaining"" (god, I hate this word, it's so dumb) and having a much better time without realizing it, yet still complaining, comes off as out of touch and insensitive, only to be shown to regret being blind to things and having his own feelings and frustrations to overcome. The interaction with ""the other moms"" was also nicely done, switching from a general dislike and lack of empathy to realizing they were probably feeling the same way themselves.nnThe dog thing... I don't know what to say. Apparently Amy Adams is cute even in dog form, but other than that it felt just a little bit gimmicky. It's true that I wouldn't have watched the film without Amy Adams in it and the promise of some fantastic elements, but I still feel cheated. Same applies to the sweaty dirty sexy Adams on the posters, when she is an overweight mommy throughout the film. BTW, her transformation in the film is dramatic. I don't know if she gained weight for this or it was more on the prosthetics side, but she embodied postpartum mom.nnBottom line: I have not read the book this is based on, so I don't know how good of an adaption it is, but it felt like a serious film, done with care and carried really well by all actors involved. I didn't love it, but also I can see how this is good. I will rate it average, though, because of the gimmick and poster bait and switch thing.

Mulan's community at the start of the film seem more concerned about her getting married and having babies than being happy. I thought this would change when it became clear that Mulan didn't fit in, or at least when she returned home as a war hero at the end, but nope. It's never really challenged. We're meant to forgive Shang for being angry at Mulan and leaving her behind for being a woman, even though he never really does anything to redeem himself. There are some visually impressive moments and one good song, and it does seem like they *tried* to give it a satisfying ending, but this film mostly just made me angry.

rw10242703,tt0094721,Beetlejuice (1988),"This movie could've been really good, but it spends a lot of its (already short) runtime showing off the designs of the ghosts and sets, and as a result the plot, pacing and characterization really suffer. We never really find out why Adam and Barbara, or even Lydia, dislike Lydia's family so much. We as the audience are meant to dislike them because they're rich and entitled, but do the other characters have the same reasoning? Who knows! Lydia clearly feels different from other people and at points seems to genuinely want to die, but we never find out why beyond her being goth (or something similar) and considering herself ""strange and unusual"". Then at the end she suddenly seems happy and to fit in with other teenagers, despite not much in her life really having changed. I have no idea if she was meant to have being going through a 'not like the other girls' phase and the ending shows her growing out of it, if the film thinks it's cool to be 'not like the other girls', or if the filmmakers genuinely believed that every goth and/or teenager is suicidal and socially isolated. Because they never tell us! This leaves Lydia feeling very undeveloped, which is a big problem with the other characters too. Adam and Barbara aren't developed beyond 'nice couple who feel protective of Lydia', Lydia's parents are never developed beyond 'rich entitled people', and Beetlejuice is never developed beyond 'perverted ghost'. The film is paced messily too. Adam and Barbara dying and Lydia moving in is rushed over, the ghosts trying to scare the humans away is dragged out, and the characters preventing the wedding near the end is rushed, and it's not even clarified how Barbara was able to control the sandworm and get it back to the house to defeat Beetlejuice. Adam and Barbara's relationship with Lydia is sweet, but like the characters it's underdeveloped.nnI guess this film is loved because of its creative character design for the ghosts and set design for the afterlife, and because people find it funny (the humour isn't to my taste personally) but I was disappointed that such a beloved film didn't have stronger plot and characterization.",A,06/01/2025

The series shines a spotlight on Miep Gies, the brave and compassionate woman who risked her life to shelter the Frank family and other Jews in a hidden annex. Through its deeply emotional narrative, the series portrays the resilience of those facing unimaginable oppression and the humanity of those who sought to help them.nnThe series effectively conveys the plight of the Jewish people during the Holocaust, drawing viewers into the raw, heartbreaking reality of their hidden existence. It evokes powerful emotions, making it difficult not to feel the weight of their suffering and the courage of those like Miep who stood against tyranny.nnWhile A Small Light serves as a reminder of the atrocities faced by Jews during World War II, it also invites reflection on how historical narratives can shape perceptions. In the context of modern conflicts like Gaza and Israel, the series raises questions about how the legacy of victimhood and resilience can be overshadowed by actions that diverge from those values.nnThe series succeeds in highlighting the universal themes of compassion, courage, and the fight against injustice, while subtly urging viewers to consider how historical narratives and contemporary realities intersect.",A,06/01/2025

In ""My Old Ass,"" we meet Elliot, an eighteen-year-old gay girl eager to escape her family's cranberry farm. One night, after tripping on mushrooms, she encounters her future self, a relaxed thirty-nine-year-old woman. Elliot is left bewildered: is she hallucinating? Can this easy-going woman really be her two decades ahead? As the older version shares details about her college life and future relationships, she warns Elliot about a guy she should steer clear of.nnThe film balances humor and heart, combining silly moments with poignant ones. Young Elliot, played beautifully by Maisy Stella, spends time with friends, shares sweet yet innocent moments with her boyfriend, connects with her family, and faces the arrival of The New Boy in Town (portrayed by the talented Percy Hynes White), which disrupts her final carefree weeks before college. Some scenes will bring smiles, while others may bring tears; a particularly touching moment occurs between Elliot and her mother, who already feels the ache of missing her.nnStarting as a light-hearted comedy, ""My Old Ass"" evolves into a sensitive exploration of a young woman at a pivotal point in her life. By the end, it becomes one of the most insightful and impactful films I've seen this year. Aubrey Plaza delivers her usual subtly expressive performance as the older Elliot, and the stunning Canadian landscape almost feels like a character itself.

There were four in the fridge, then one was opened by Ocho before another two were consumed by him and Javier when they have a moment in the Airbnb. That left one, but in the final sequence there were three. Ocho had been alone all of the time, meaning all the sequences with Javier were imagined. And that, thankfully, poor Sonia never died in New York.nnI would have personally liked the lad in the park to have had a bigger part (so to speak), and question if we were really that fearful of HIV in 1999. In 1989, yes. Things had moved on a decade later. And if Ocho had had so much sex that he'd forgotten that night with Javier, he certainly wasn't as fearful as is suggested. The sex scenes were devoid of affection, as is so often the way in porn, on TV and in films.nnI was left wondering what might have been had some of my own encounters worked out differently. 'What Might Have Been' would have been a better title for the film and would have pointed viewers in the right direction from the outset.",A,06/01/2025

rw10242543,tt0247586,Nueve reinas (2000),"""Nueve Reinas,"" directed by Fabián Bielinsky, is a captivating Argentine film that masterfully intertwines elements of crime, drama, and dark comedy.

With its intricate plot, sharp dialogue, and outstanding performances, ""Nueve Reinas"" is a thrilling ride that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.nnAt the heart of the film are two con artists, Marcos (Germán Palacios) and Juan (Ricardo Darín), whose paths cross in a bustling Buenos Aires. Marcos is a seasoned grifter with a wealth of experience, while Juan is a younger, less experienced hustler looking to make his mark. Their chemistry is palpable, and the dynamic between the two characters drives the film forward. Darín's portrayal of Juan is particularly noteworthy; he captures the character's vulnerability and ambition with finesse, making him relatable even as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of con artistry.nnThe plot revolves around a high-stakes con involving a rare set of stamps known as the ""Nueve Reinas"" (Nine Queens). As Marcos and Juan attempt to pull off this elaborate scheme, the film delves into themes of trust, betrayal, and the blurred lines between reality and deception. The screenplay is tightly woven, filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. Just when you think you have figured out the characters' motivations, the story takes another sharp turn, showcasing Bielinsky's skillful storytelling.nnOne of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to balance humor with tension.

Each character adds depth to the story, from the enigmatic figures they encounter to those who complicate their schemes. The interactions between characters reveal layers of complexity in their motivations and desires, enriching the overall narrative.nn""Nueve Reinas"" is not just a heist film; it is a commentary on human nature and the lengths people will go to achieve their goals.

As Marcos and Juan navigate their way through a world built on lies, viewers are left to ponder what it truly means to be honest in a dishonest world.nnThe film's ending is particularly noteworthy, leaving audiences with a sense of ambiguity that lingers long after the credits roll.

rw10242518,tt18559464,My Old Ass (2024),"I like movies that start with the question ""What if😁...?"" Those simple but profound plots at the same time. Those stories that develop in a peaceful context, that encourages the audience's thinking. I like them because these are the instances where you can get to know yourself a little better if you do the exercise that the movie poses to you. The script of My Old Ass is precisely that, simple but that invites you to think about yourself, to put yourself in the place of the protagonist and ask yourself ""What would you do?"".nnThe leading performances help everything flow well, despite the secondary performances, which do not all work as efficient support for the main roles. The locations are wonderful. The direction is on point, focused on the story rather than boasting with daring shots. Perhaps the soundtrack is a bit austere, especially with the small plot twist in the last act. Even so, it contributes its grain of sand.nnThe most sensitive moviegoers will receive this film like a tear-gas bomb to the chest, but will end up feeling good.

Additionally, a long-time member of the gang, Danny, has been jailed...and Muggs is determined to free him as well. And, to do so, he works undercover as a member of a gang he thinks might be behind all this.nnThis is clearly a WWII positive propaganda film meant to drum up support for the country at war. As such, it's pretty good stuff and is pretty entertaining...especially for an East Side Kids film. Overall, a bit more intelligent than usual for the franchise...with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey playing it more seriously and less for dopey laughs.nnBy the way, although Billy Benedict played Spider, he soon became Whitey...a DIFFERENT member of the gang.

It all follows the usual path of a hero who falls in love with the princess to the chagrin of his boss who also has designs on her! In this case it's the princess ""Zafir"" (Helen Gilbert) who is the object of everyone's desir; ""Amdar"" (Paul Henreid) the man she loves and ""Khalid"" (John Sutton) the malevolent usurper who would have her father's kingdom and his daughter. Fortunately for them, and us, she has the assistance of the wily ""Sheherazade"" (Jeff Donnell) and there's the occupier of the magic cave, too. He is, of course, ""Ali Baba"" (Philip Van Zandt) and he might just be persuaded to help out. Oh, right, and there's also ""Sinbad"" (Lon Chaney Jr.) just to keep the ""Arabian Nights"" theme fully exploited throughout. With a public execution looming, it is going to fall to the heroic men to save the sultan and his daughter from the scimitar, but will they manage to overcome the city walls and the overwhelming number of royal guards in time? Nothing remotely original, no, but I did quite enjoy this theatrically delivered costume romp, especially the lively effort from Donnell who clearly thinks she's more than a match for any man (character or actor). There's plenty of action to stop the romance getting too cheesy and though Henreid is as wooden as a cedar tree, his talents mix well with the rest of the mediocrity on offer here to present us with a perfectly watchable adventure film.",A,06/01/2025

rw10242305,tt21960200,Click Click Bang (2022),"Click Click Bang (2022) is a Kenyan film that ambitiously tries to blend comedy with the gritty realities of urban life, but its execution leaves much to be desired. Here's a comprehensive review:nnPlot and Themes: At its core, Click Click Bang follows Kev, a talented footballer whose career falters, leading him into a world of crime to support his terminally ill sister. The movie attempts to weave together themes of corruption, ambition, and the harsh life in Nairobi's ghettos. While the premise is promising, the execution feels somewhat clichéd, with the storyline often falling back on familiar tropes of crime dramas. The plot takes time to develop, with some scenes feeling unnecessary or disconnected from the main narrative.nnPerformances: The cast includes notable Kenyan actors, with Nyakundi Isaboke and Basil Mungai delivering standout performances. Their acting adds a layer of authenticity and emotion to their characters, providing some of the film's more memorable moments. However, not all performances are equally compelling, and the heavy use of profanity by some characters can feel excessive, potentially overshadowing the acting talent.nnDirection and Visuals: Directed by Philip Karanja and Michael Munyoki, Click Click Bang boasts some visually appealing aspects. The choice of locations, costumes, and music are well-suited to the setting, providing a vivid backdrop for the story. However, the direction sometimes lacks finesse, with pacing issues making the film feel longer than its runtime. The humor, intended to lighten the mood, doesn't always land, feeling forced and detracting from the dramatic elements.nnMusic and Soundtrack: The soundtrack is one of the film's strengths, incorporating local Kenyan music that enhances the cultural authenticity and atmosphere of the movie. It's well-integrated into pivotal scenes, helping to elevate the emotional beats of the narrative.nnCritical Reception: Audience reviews are mixed, with some appreciating the attempt at telling a local story with local talent. On IMDb, the film has a rating of 7.2, indicating a generally favorable reception among those who appreciate its cultural context. However, critics have pointed out the overuse of profane language, the slow plot development, and the occasionally disjointed storytelling. There's a consensus that while the film has heart and showcases Kenyan cinema, it could benefit from tighter scripting and editing.nnConclusion: Click Click Bang is a film with a lot of potential but falls short in fully realizing it. It's commendable for its attempt to portray the struggles and dreams within Nairobi's less privileged communities through a mix of comedy and drama. The performances, especially by the leads, are a highlight, but the narrative structure and pacing issues prevent it from being a standout film. For fans of local Kenyan cinema or those interested in narratives that explore the intersection of sports, crime, and social commentary, Click Click Bang might be worth watching, but with an understanding that it's not without flaws.",A,06/01/2025

rw10242224,tt20221436,Emilia Pérez (2024),"Much like the Mexican cartel boss and his/her/their confused identity, the movie can't quite figure out what it wants to be either.nnGranting it the status of a musical in the same year that saw the release of Wicked is like calling The Shining a dramedy. Neither is it a rock opera (despite Selina Gomez' and Zoe Saldana's best efforts), but with no memorable songs to sing along to, the movie is best when it sticks to the drama.nnAnd it's a terrific concept: a tough-as-nails cartel boss that has always identified as a woman seeks a sex change and a new start in life. But while you can take the cartel boss out of the picture, you can't make the violent manipulator disappear quite as easily.nnThat should have been enough to hang a movie on, but director Jacques Audiard has to ""auteur things up,"" flitting between genres, locales, lyrics and plot lines with the abandonment of a twink at a Bangkok sex change emporium where everything is on the menu (probably the best example of a scene included for no real purpose).nnWith so many issues, it's no wonder Audiard opts to just blow it all up in a rather cartoonish way, rather than allow his characters to discover a way through the mess. After all, with a little harder work, our future shouldn't have to be defined by our past - nor would this movie have to be defined by its shortcomings.",A,06/01/2025

rw10242219,tt0103776,Batman Returns (1992),"Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992) stands as a strikingly bold sequel to his 1989 Batman, delving deeper into the gothic, surreal, and psychologically twisted world of Gotham City. With its dark themes, unforgettable performances, and unique visual aesthetic, the film remains a divisive yet iconic entry in the superhero genre.nnSet during Christmas in Gotham, Batman Returns presents a city under siege by bizarre villains: the vengeful and tragic Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the seductive yet unpredictable Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton) faces his own internal battles, juggling his dual identity as Gotham's masked vigilante and a man yearning for connection. Burton crafts a tale less about heroics and more about the fractured identities of its central characters, turning Gotham into a twisted stage for psychological exploration.nnOne of the film's greatest strengths is its cast, with Michael Keaton reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Keaton plays the part with a subdued intensity, making his Batman both mysterious and introspective. His performance is overshadowed, however, by Danny DeVito's grotesque portrayal of the Penguin. DeVito fully embraces the character's monstrous persona, delivering a performance that is equal parts pitiable and horrifying. The Penguin's backstory-a child abandoned by his wealthy parents and raised in the sewers-adds a tragic dimension, making him a villain driven by a mixture of revenge and a yearning for acceptance.nnMichelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, meanwhile, steals the show with her magnetic performance. Transforming from the meek, overlooked Selina Kyle into a vengeful femme fatale after a near-death experience, Pfeiffer imbues Catwoman with a blend of sensuality, vulnerability, and unhinged fury. Her chemistry with Keaton's Batman provides the film's emotional core, as their masked alter-egos grapple with a mutual attraction complicated by their conflicting agendas.nnChristopher Walken's portrayal of Max Shreck, a corrupt corporate tycoon, adds another layer of villainy to the film. While Shreck lacks the flamboyance of the Penguin or Catwoman, Walken's icy demeanor and ruthless ambition make him a compelling antagonist, embodying Gotham's unchecked greed and corruption.nnVisually, Batman Returns is a feast for the eyes. Burton, working with production designer Bo Welch, transforms Gotham into a nightmarish dreamscape, blending art deco influences with gothic architecture. Snow-covered streets, towering skyscrapers, and shadowy alleyways create a city that feels both oppressive and otherworldly. Danny Elfman's haunting score complements the visuals, heightening the film's macabre atmosphere.nnThe film's darker tone and unconventional narrative make it a departure from traditional superhero fare. Burton eschews the action-packed spectacle typical of the genre in favor of exploring themes of isolation, duality, and societal rejection. Each character-Batman, Catwoman, and the Penguin-is an outcast struggling to reconcile their fractured identities, blurring the lines between hero and villain. This thematic depth, however, may alienate viewers expecting a straightforward superhero adventure.nnCritics at the time of its release were divided over the film's tone and content. While some praised its ambition and artistry, others criticized its bleakness and grotesque imagery, particularly the Penguin's disturbing antics. The film's violent and sexual undertones sparked controversy, leading to backlash from parents who found it too dark for younger audiences. These factors contributed to Warner Bros. Opting for a lighter approach in subsequent Batman films.nnDespite its polarizing reception, Batman Returns has aged well, earning recognition as a unique and influential entry in the superhero genre. Its dark aesthetic and complex characters paved the way for more mature comic book adaptations, influencing later works like The Dark Knight trilogy. The film's emphasis on flawed, multidimensional characters set a new standard, proving that superhero stories could be both visually stunning and emotionally resonant.nnIn conclusion, Batman Returns is a bold, visually striking, and thematically rich film that pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre. While its darker elements may not appeal to all audiences, its compelling performances, haunting visuals, and exploration of complex themes make it a standout entry in Batman's cinematic legacy. Over three decades later, it remains a testament to Tim Burton's unique vision and a reminder of the creative possibilities within the genre.",A,06/01/2025
rw10242198,tt33030375,Anul Nou care n-a fost (2024),"This movie is the result of a cow that has been milked abusively in the past 35 years by romanian filmmakers. The comedy was lukewarm, but all in all, the biggest flaw in this movie is it's apathy at truly criticizing the societal flaws from back then. In fact, it almost seems apologetic. Let me explain.nnSo, one plotline that really pissed me off was that of Gelu (the handyman with his family and the letter his son sends saying he wants Ceausescu to die). It was just horrid, not funny, to see on screen how that father is being very abusive with his wife and kid, just out of fear. I was cringing the whole time. Throughout the movie, nothing redeeming happens to Gelu. Life goes on, both for him and his scarred wife and kid. There is no redemption ark or something. He just scares them into submission, beats them, and that's supposed to be ""funny"". Also, Gelu is not inherently the comical device, but his child who doesn't ""listen to him"", which is a failure at criticizing this really problematic behaviour from those times.nnThe old lady with the house was such a boring segment. In the beginning I thought it was a metaphor for people who can't let go of the past. Then it turns into a study into dementia, but ends up being neither. It's just dragged out for too long, trying to humanize the secret police officer, but failing to make me empathize more. In fact, all the scenes in that house have very repetitive and useless dialogue. ""I want you to move out"", ""no"" - and this is recycled ad nauseam. NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.nnThe plotline with the two students trying to ""Hawaii"" themselves to the Yugoslav border is also pretty standard and obviously forseeable. It was nothing new, planned escape attempt goes wrong, and the police state beats you up. Anything new here? No, of course.nnThe only redeeming plotline that I really enjoyed was that of the television crew trying to remake a deleted scene before new year's eve. That was pretty fresh and interesting to see. And we also have a little character development showing how the actress escapes the grip of the abusive theatre director. That was cool. But this should have been a standalone short film.nnAnyway, in conclusion, this movie's nothing new, and it also attempts to recycle past problematic behaviours and personalities, without attempting to properly satirize or criticize anything. It's too safe and exploratory to differentiate itself from other commieslop romanian movies.",A,06/01/2025
rw10242182,tt18559464,My Old Ass (2024),"In a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and superhero sagas, ""My Old Ass"" (2024) emerges as a refreshing and heartfelt gem that invites audiences to reflect on aging with humor and grace. Directed by the talented Elle Monroe, this film skillfully blends comedy, drama, and a touch of magical realism to deliver an engaging and thought-provoking experience.nnAt the center of the film is Gus Peterson, played brilliantly by the seasoned actor Harold Finch. Gus is a retired schoolteacher whose life has settled into a monotonous routine, marked by the mundane rhythms of daily life in his small hometown. Finch brings a wonderful nuance to the character, striking a perfect balance between the grumpiness of old age and the vulnerability that comes with it. His portrayal of Gus is both comical and poignant, capturing the essence of a man who grapples with his past while attempting to navigate the challenges of his present.nnThe plot takes an unexpected turn when Gus discovers a mysterious antique mirror at a local thrift shop, which possesses the uncanny ability to show him a version of himself at various ages throughout his life. This clever narrative device allows the film to explore the passage of time and the memories that define us. Gus's interactions with his younger selves, portrayed by a talented cast of up-and-coming actors, generate moments of humor and bittersweet nostalgia. Viewers are treated to flashbacks that reveal pivotal moments in Gus's life: youthful dreams, lost friendships, and unfulfilled ambitions. The film resonates with anyone who has looked back at their life with both longing and regret.nnSupporting Gus is a lively ensemble cast that adds depth and richness to the narrative. Karen, playfully portrayed by the energetic Lily Reyes, is Gus's feisty neighbor who challenges him to reconnect with the world outside of his grumpy shell. Their dynamic is refreshingly authentic, filled with witty banter and genuine friendship. Karen's relentless positivity acts as a catalyst for Gus's transformation, reminding him of the importance of community and connection.nnThe cinematography in ""My Old Ass"" beautifully captures the essence of small-town life. The warm, golden hues of the setting sun, the quaint streets filled with vibrant storefronts, and the cozy interiors of Gus's home create a nostalgic atmosphere that envelops the audience. The film's score, composed by the talented Mia Sutton, complements the visuals perfectly, oscillating between lighthearted tunes and introspective melodies that underscore key emotional moments.nnWhat sets ""My Old Ass"" apart from typical aging narratives is its ability to treat the theme of growing old with respect and humor. Elle Monroe's direction ensures that the comedic elements don't belittle the struggles that come with aging; instead, they work in harmony to uplift the story. The film deftly tackles issues such as loneliness, regret, and the fear of becoming irrelevant, but it does so without devolving into sentimentality. Instead, it encourages viewers to embrace each stage of life with grit and laughter.nnAs the story unfolds, Gus embarks on a journey of self-discovery, pushing against the limitations he initially imposed upon himself. The film's message is clear: life, regardless of age, is a continuous journey filled with new opportunities and experiences waiting to be embraced. The climax is particularly touching, as Gus learns to reconcile his past with his present, leading to a satisfying and uplifting conclusion that resonates long after the credits roll.nnIn conclusion, ""My Old Ass"" (2024) is a delightful exploration of age, memory, and personal growth that stands out in today's cinematic offerings. With stellar performances, a clever premise, and a genuine heart, this film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates a well-told story that celebrates the beauty of life at every age. Whether you're young or old, this film will remind you that every moment matters and that it's never too late to rewrite your own story.",A,06/01/2025

Maybe they aren't aware of what's going on today, let alone what was happening in the 1940s. Maybe they should get off FB and pick up an actual history book (or actually paying attention during history class at any level of school would have saved them a lot of time, but I digress.) I loved this movie for highlighting a story that needed to be told. Kerry Washington was amazing, as she always is. My only complaint is this was too short. This movie deserved more than 2 hours to tell this amazing story. The most important part, how these amazing women were able to clear this ridiculous backlog of mail in a war zone was really glossed over. Yes, there are military inaccuracies. The opening combat scene made me cringe in so many ways, but it's fine, because this is not a combat movie and should not be compared to something claiming to be. Overall, this was an excellent movie and one that I can't wait to show my own two daughters when they are old enough to understand all the thematic elements.",A,06/01/2025
rw10242138,tt8230448,"""A Gentleman in Moscow"" (2024)","Soviet Russia, 1921. The country is under war communism: food is scarce and rationed, absolutely all businesses are under control of the government, obligatory labor duty is enforced. Don't expect to see any of this. Instead, you'll see Bolsheviks executing people right on the streets or in a hotel lobby because they weren't told they're not the Cheka.nnCount Rostov has been living in a Metropol Hotel throughout the Revolution and Civil War without lifting a finger. Naturally, he's arrested and tried. The sentence is imprisonment for life. Not in a prison, as you or any other person in the world would expect. In a hotel. The same hotel where he lived for the last several years. The Bolsheviks, in their unadulterated hatred for freeloading, decided that the proper punishment for Rostov is to live as a freeloader for the rest of his life. Count's conditions are abysmal: he dines with wine and veal, he regularly visits a barber to trim his curled mustache, his clothes and bed are clean and slick. Those damned Red barbarians.nnA Gentleman in Moscow is an outrageous comedy show, akin to Police Squad or Reno 911. To say it's frivolous in terms of historical accuracy would be wrong. No, it deliberately alters and twists as much as possible. Not in a quirky, self-aware way, like The Great, no. It's a deadpan comedy. Here, we have bizarre script involving characters who'd be dead before Lenin died, played by the infamous British ""color-blind casting"" actors, who are not even any good. It's all fun and games until there's a Minister of Culture depicted as a Black gay man.nnWhatever the creators intended to do, they failed miserably. The show is not believable in the slightest. It's an atrocious, disrespectful and distasteful reflection of the time it was created in, not the time it depicts. It's a bastardizing of Russian history, as long and rich as Britain's. The only difference is that Russia would never think of wasting its time to make a big-budget show with Maori Churchill playing Fortnite with Asian Elizabeth II.",A,06/01/2025
rw10242131,tt0087078,Conan the Destroyer (1984),"After Conan the Barbarian, a raw and savage monument, here comes Conan the Destroyer, which feels more like a carnival ride than an epic saga. Gone are the depth, darkness, and poetry. Richard Fleischer serves up a light Conan with dialogue as sharp as a plastic spoon. Arnold is still rocking the loincloth and ready to smash some skulls, but this time, he's less barbarian and more... babysitter.nnLet's talk about Grace Jones. She spends the entire film screaming like she just stepped on a Lego. Sure, she exudes raw energy, but at this point, it's less intensity and more auditory harassment. Every time she opens her mouth, it's like a blender starts up in the background. The worst part? You end up laughing... nervously.nnThe quest for Dagoth's magical horn? Seriously? Even an episode of Scooby-Doo is better written. Between predictable betrayals, fizzling incantations, and swords sparking with every clash (thanks, built-in matches), you're left wondering if anyone proofread the script before filming. We're a long way from the dark and weighty plots of the first installment.nnAh, Mako. In the first movie, he was the mysterious narrator and badass sorcerer. Here, he's reduced to tossing out three spells that feel like they're from a beginner's magic workshop, standing in the background, looking like he's questioning his life choices. At this point, they might as well have hired an extra to read his lines.nnAnd yet, despite all the incoherent, kitschy chaos, Conan the Destroyer manages to make you smile. Whether it's Arnold fighting in his underwear or villains sporting cardboard costumes, the film throws you into such absurdity that you end up enjoying it. It's like eating a kebab at 4 a.m.-you know it's not good, but somehow, it works.nnConan the Destroyer tears apart everything that made its predecessor great. But if you embrace the second-degree humor, Grace Jones' screams, and the dialogue seemingly written by an intern, you might have an almost fun time.

A lot is done to help make up for that by how this truly embraces being the silver screen version of a bedtime story. This is far from the only of these two open on the image of a book to underline the fact that it's an adaptation since that's what the studio was doing until fairly recently. But it is the first and possibly only to play with that. The narrator can talk directly to the people a non-zero amount of times, someone almost goes flying off the page until they turn to the next one, etc. In addition a lot of the humor comes from verbal comedy, imagine g rated Blackadder, so there's rhyming, double meaning and more. This delivers everything that we at the time expected from it's ilk; it's fun funny cute exciting communicates its positive messages well the animation is smooth, they had really gotten the hang of making humans look right by this point much better than the otherwise excellent but occasionally awkward Snow White, everything moves exactly as is supposed to unless that's the gag.nnI believe it is accurate to the source material so I can't credit this with inventing it; rather I'll acknowledge how great it is that it's stays true to how different the personalities of the characters are, and often the ones you would expect to be anxious based on the animal they are, also are here. For example the rabbit and the piglet who's so nervous that even when he writes his name he stutters. In today's vernacular Tigger has ADHD. He's easily distracted and has a one-track mind, wants to do the thing he likes all the time even when it gets him in trouble, others sometimes find him annoying on account of all this. We have to learn to live with each other's quirks rather than try to fix each other we have to operate from a place of empathy. In closing when Winnie the Pooh himself is stuck in the hole that leads into the bunny's home, we get the most concentrated instance of something that appeared in all of the other features from The Corporation leading up to it, and that is of course butt centric jokes.

In retrospect, I'm lucky nothing really awful ever happened to me and so glad I never went to a big spring break location. If a girl is underaged, consumed alcohol and can't walk or speak on her own - she cannot give consent. Period. This guy rivals our new president in his narcissism, truly shocking. Multiple audio and video tapes of his abuse, so many lawsuits in the US and other countries that I lost track. The author of the article/main interviewer/narrator is so incredibly well spoken and so clearly did her due diligence. I hope Joe Francis rots alone in a tiny apartment after he's extradited and prosecuted.

Its not the best don't get me wrong and suffers from cheesiness but the action is often fun enough. The CGI is mostly alright but there are times when it looks pretty average or in the case of Henry Cavells moustache removal, downright horrible. There's also some questionable camera angles and physical humour, particularly involving Woman Woman, that could be considered sexist. I'm not as concerned about that stuff but it is noticeable when it happens. Compared to Zack Snyders Justice League Cut, this version does have a couple things going for it - runtime and colour. The 2017 Justice League is a more manageable 2hrs in length (which is still 2hrs 20 minutes shorter than Snyders!) and the colour theme is brighter, whereas Snyders was quite dull and brown a lot of the time.nnFinal Verdict: It's a okay film.

rw10241735,tt32501221,"""Selling the City"" (2025)","The show is very disappointing, especially considering its title. A show called ""Selling"" should deliver on its promise of showcasing sales, but instead, it falls flat. It's baffling how a concept centered around selling, whether it's luxury real estate or high-stakes business deals, barely includes any of the selling process at all. There's no real insight into how deals are closed, no behind-the-scenes look at negotiations, and no strategies revealed that could captivate viewers. The title misleads the audience into expecting a focus on the actual art of selling, yet what we're given is something entirely different.nnInstead of focusing on selling, the show leans heavily into drama-far too much drama. While drama can add a layer of entertainment to a reality series, in this case, it completely overshadows the premise. Audiences tune in to see aspirational lifestyles, entrepreneurial skills, and success stories, but what they get is petty squabbles and overproduced conflict. The balance is entirely off, and it feels like the producers prioritized creating sensational moments over showcasing substance. If drama was meant to enhance the narrative, it should have been used sparingly to complement the selling aspect, not dominate the show entirely.nnMoreover, the lack of diversity is glaring and deeply problematic, especially given the city the show is set in. The cast does not adequately represent the multicultural vibrancy of one of the most diverse cities in the world. This missed opportunity is not just disappointing-it's a disservice to the audience and to the city itself. A diverse cast would have brought fresh perspectives, richer stories, and a more authentic reflection of the city's demographic makeup. Instead, the cast feels homogeneous, making the show feel disconnected from the real-world community it's supposed to portray.nnRepresentation matters, and in a time when audiences are calling for more inclusivity, the show's lack of diversity feels like a step backward. It's not just about ticking boxes; it's about capturing the essence of a diverse city and showing the different ways people navigate their professional and personal lives. A show set in a global, multicultural city should reflect that reality, and this one falls short in a way that feels tone-deaf and uninspired.nnTo improve, the show needs to reassess its priorities. First and foremost, it should deliver on its promise of focusing on selling. Viewers are drawn to shows like this to gain insights into the hustle, the negotiation skills, and the innovative ways professionals close deals. Including more scenes that explore the intricacies of the selling process-client interactions, marketing strategies, and challenges faced-would make the show far more engaging and informative. Audiences don't want a superficial glimpse; they want to feel inspired by the effort and creativity that goes into high-stakes sales.nnSecondly, the drama needs to be dialed down and used as a seasoning rather than the main dish. Conflict can be engaging, but it should not overshadow the core theme of the show. Producers need to strike a balance, allowing viewers to connect with the cast on a professional level while still enjoying occasional glimpses into their personal lives.nnFinally, the cast desperately needs an overhaul to include individuals from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. This would not only make the show more relatable to a broader audience but also enhance the narrative with new and compelling perspectives. A more inclusive approach would elevate the show, making it more authentic and representative of the community it aims to showcase.nnIn its current form, the show feels like a missed opportunity on multiple levels. The misleading title, excessive drama, and lack of diversity are significant flaws that prevent it from resonating with viewers. With some thoughtful changes, it could transform into a show that not only entertains but also informs and inspires. For now, however, it remains a disappointment that fails to live up to its potential.",A,06/01/2025

At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, ""what we've got here is failure to communicate"" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys.

What's really funny is all the reviews mad about the film showing the racism that existed, but not at the fact that racism actually existed during wartime! LOL. That was the best and most consistent part of the story. It showed how ridiculous and unnecessary racism is and how all it does is compound whatever problem you're going through. McQueen wasn't making a ""statement"" or trying to ""add"" to the movie by showing this, he was simply explaining what life would have been for a mixed race little boy during that time.

That was my feeling in 1981 and the people I was with thought the same leaving us all baffled at the acclaim. All these years later, my opinion hasn't changed. I give this a fairly high rating because the acting is very good as is the excellent cinematography and of course, there is that very famous musical score, which was beautiful until so overplayed on sports shows, commercials, events, etc, it became an eye roller after a while. I've rated this low because this story of two runners aiming for and eventually participating in the Olympics of 1924 where one is running for God and the other because he's an angry Jew trying to prove himself is boring much of the time despite being a quality piece of filmmaking. I read here that 40 minutes were cut due to studio insistence, a fact I've never heard before. I usually balk at such news, but not in this case.

The Fab Five's genuine care, humor, and expertise have turned each episode into an inspiring journey of transformation-not just for the heroes they help, but for viewers like me.nnThat said, Season 9 feels like a departure from the magic that made Queer Eye so special in its earlier seasons. While it's important to acknowledge the incredible talent and dedication of the Fab Five (and to emphasize that my critique has nothing to do with the new team dynamic), the way the season is shot leaves much to be desired.nnThe production choices this time feel overly polished, as though the focus has shifted from the authenticity of their interactions to a strange emphasis on manicured poses or random staged activities. The result feels forced, almost bordering on the kind of overly scripted vibe we associate with shows like Selling Sunset.

I went in with high hopes, but after investing four hours of my time, I found it to be an absolute waste. It was a painful experience, What made it even worse was how unrealistic the events were, especially as they led to a disaster. The selfishness of the daughter and the selflessness of the father were both exaggerated to the point of absurdity, making their actions seem contrived and unconvincing. It was frustrating to watch such unbelievable character choices unfold, and it only added to the overall disappointment.",A,06/01/2025
rw10241490,tt2380307,Coco (2017/I),"The plot to this movie isn't anything crazy out or out of this world. Its core conflict starts early in the movie, centering around family and whether family should drive one's own future or be able to find one's own future through passion and skill. The idea of being generational trauma (a parent abandoning a family, whether intentional or not, for a music career) plays heavily into the movie and how that unfolds over generations. The movie as a whole pulls at the heartstrings when a family pulls together and loves each other despite being mad at each other. I definitely felt like this movie did a good job of handling tough topics and bringing both joy and sadness in equal measure.nnSurrounding the plot of the movie involves a lot of folklore and tradition, pulling in good music, animation and storytelling. The animation was spectacular, as are most Pixar movies in my opinion, as it pulls in a lot of culture themes such as the Day of the Dead and includes a lot of color without overdoing it. The movie's concept of the Land of the Dead is novel and gave a concept of a city beyond ours where the dead lived, worked and partied. The music was amazing, centering around the guitar, and the singing was amazing by all actors.",A,06/01/2025
rw10241488,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Okay, hear me out...this story felt like the character of Samuel was a sort of version of Mary Poppins, but sexual. He came into this woman's life when he was needed and left when he was no longer needed. Doesn't that sound like Mary Poppins to you?nnThe story, as we know, is about a bored wife that hasn't gotten an orgasm from her husband and we see that she can only climax watching porn and masturbating on her own. She has fantasies that have yet to be explored because her wants and needs have been kept silent in fear of being judged as being ""abnormal"" by her husband.nnSo, in comes at the most opportune time a man named Samuel that seems to have the qualities she is needing most and he has also fully picked up on. Perhaps he is an empath and is fully aware of the situation but it seems as two consenting adults go forth and explore this unknown territory together it brings out the version of Romy (Nicole Kidman) that she has been needing to set free. It's all about communication and consent folks. The big issue is that he is an intern and she is an executive so it makes it into a power struggle...but not for long.nnWhen things get too dangerous for her in keeping her job and her family together, she wants to back off. In fear of Samuel asking to be transferred and an investigation ensuing, she lets it continue to run its course. The sub and dom elements in this film were slight but okay, I can see how intriguing that can be but the control over a dog aspect between Samuel in the beginning and the end when Jacob (Antonio Banderas) and Romy were exploring each other in new ways because of how Samuel opened up a new world for them both, why keep showing Samuel and the dog while Romy is climaxing? Does she feel like she is the dog because, if so, that feels just so wrong.nnAnyways, Samuel ended up being transferred to a new company in Hong Kong or Tokyo or wherever I can't remember but he left as easily as he came into their lives...much like Mary Poppins. They have a happier marriage now and everyone lives happily ever after. That about sums it up.nnNicole Kidman was stellar as Romy and I loved how she opened herself up and had shown a side of her that she hasn't shown before. The vulnerability was beautiful and I appreciate her ability to take on such a role.nnThe soundtrack was fantastic. I quite enjoyed the 80's mixed into the synth pop and enveloping the storyline to help the characters along the way.nnI loved it. It probably was the best idea going to see it with my dad (he wanted to see it and my mom didn't want to go so I volunteered.)

And for the last 2 days, I felt compelled to watch it and finish it.nnBut I felt like I was chewing ashes in my mouth after it was done. And realized I was taken on a journey where I felt like I had to participate, but the journey was unconvincing and I didn't like how it ended.nnI felt like I was rooting for the main character as much as I was getting convinced about his not being guilty. At times it even felt like there was logic, what felt like strong logic to the story.nnPlenty of scenes throughout the series try to paint a picture of people being imperfect or making poor life choices and at the same time trying to convince you those choices are truly bad but then it feels like these characters aren't really paying any price for those choices.nnTake the lead character for instance. He's transgressed big time, cheated on his wife and his children, yet they stay by him unflinchingly, only ever so slightly asking fearful questions about his potential guilt or not really provoking him. That guy has the support any cheating man can ever wish for. For his family to be so epically gaslit, it's just difficult to believe.nnAnd the problem with the entire series is that there are plenty of situations or cases where it's difficult to believe what happens. And because there's an illogical lack of real-life consequences (despite the Stockholm syndrome portrayed by the family plus almost anyone otherwise close to the main character), it just doesn't add up and at some point you realize you're being taken on a sequence of unexpected illogical turns just so that you second-guess or assign guilt to virtually any other character.nnTo also then end in such an epic way for the family given the huge amount of stress portrayed by the ending, and then their final scene showing some utter family bliss is just outright not acceptable. Any such big unfairness comes out in spades via ways the family members pay for somehow in the future.nnWhat's more, for the victim in the series that's portrayed several times as this gentle with kids prosecutor but then completely spit out the fact that she was pregnant in front of the child of the main character which felt diabolical to say the least... that's sheer character inconsistency. Plus, if you took so many steps to hide, why become so outright disrespectful with the guy's family? Just because she was suddenly confronted? It doesn't make any logical sense.nnThis series is a ride that keeps you glued to the screen, but that's everything it does. The character inconsistencies and the frivolity of the turn of events make it effective, but certainly not realistic of high writing quality. You'd end up feeling highly cheated, perhaps in many ways much more so than the characters' family was by his transgressions in the script.",A,06/01/2025

It completely failed to interest me, or to engage me in any way. At one point I actually checked it's classification on IMDB, just to see if was indeed meant to be a comedy; it isn't.nnIt tries to be a 'Slow Horses', but gets absolutely nowhere near, just a clichéd, boring, empty, crass pile of unbelievable, accidental comedy.nnI gave it two stars rather than one as the cast is excellent and the acting is good.

rw10241256,tt9218128,Gladiator II (2024),"It's difficult to review this movie.nnEither because it's linearly the direct sequel of Gladiator (one of the most beloved and rightly praised epics of the last 30 years), but also because the movie seems to anchor itself too much to the first one to create a real emotional connection.nnOn the other hand there are too many positive aspects on the movie to say it's not a good entertaining action flick, especially the acting (Denzel and Joseph Quinn are really the best ones) but also the exquisite costume design and the whole Rome/Colosseum environment is visually stunning and historically enlarged in a very epic way.nnI felt that perhaps Ridley Scott really had a strong personal motivation, even somehow postponed or asleep since Gladiator, to be able to drive the Roman Empire background storyline to a next level. It is clearly showing a lot more of the political and social background, now with up to date CGI technology and additional resources (and I dare to say budget and production decision making), at his disposal to do it.nnI believe he could have pitched this as an entirely independent story from Gladiator and from the initial storyline, but I also agree the sequel was hard to resist given some of the open family fragments coming from the original (especially the bastard son Lucius next steps) that perhaps he wanted to try to explore.nnDoes it work? Not entirely.nnI still think the best aspects of the movie are when flashbacks and dialogue connect to the first movie and ironically enough when some of the Hans Zimmer musical score from the first is played in the background (sorry Harry Gregson Williams, you are one of the greatest composers, but I didn't find this score very appealing).nnIn sum, I really think that if this movie was a an entirely separate one, with no direct/indirect connection to Gladiator, it could be perceived as more solid however the somehow convoluted story in the last 30 mins. And some rushed plot elements to make it emotionally tied with the original make it somehow fragile.nnThe Colosseum battle scenes are nice but I expected a lot more and much better after almost 25 years from the original, especially the CGI that was used, which given the risky choices of introducing baboons and sharks, clearly don't seem to have been the most effective ones.nnTo conclude, I felt entertained but as a direct sequel to Gladiator it's far from a genuine epic action movie. It has really good ideas (especially stretching the historical visual context) and even great characters ( with good acting) but I honestly felt that although Paul Mescal is indeed no Russel Crowe it is the Lucius/Hanno character that seems a little bit lost when compared with Maximus drive/ energy/ motivation and presence in the first one.nnLike I said, in a vacuum this could have worked better but with such a high legacy to cope with, it was almost doomed to be short to deliver.",A,05/01/2025

My only criticism is the prolonged shots of butts, twerking, etc., it was super uncomfortable watching, even by myself. I found myself fast forwarding a lot of the first hour due to this.

But it seems that the ""star's"" ego of writer and main character, Taylor Frey got in the way. His character is completely unlikable and his turnaround for the ending too sudden to make sense. Additionally, while Taylor can be a likable actor, this role was simply too big and required too much from his abilities.nnThe secondary characters don't fare much better. Rick Cosnett as Oliver comes across as that sighing princess stuck in her tower waiting to be saved rather than a sharp, successful attorney. Samer Salem is wasted in his role and also has too quick a turnaround for his character. Worst though is Daniel Garcia as Henry, who experiences ""love at first sight"" with a toxic and negative Wilde who gives him no indication that his feelings might ever be reciprocated or acknowledged. He ignores rudeness and disdain and chases after Wilde when most would have taken the first hint.nnI get that it's supposed to be a romantic holiday movie, and I really wanted to like it more.

Whereas the cinema was packed out for The Fellowship of the Ring, there were only three other people in the cinema with me for this, which is a pity.nnThe story, which is a retelling of an earlier siege of Helm's Deep by the forces of the rebellious prince Wulf, centres around Hera, Helm Hammerhand's daughter who is forced to rally the defences when her father becomes incapacitated. Unlike other stories in this universe, however, there's no quest to go on, no dragons or dark sorcerers to slay, no dwarevs or elves to deal with. It's just a conflict between Men.nnAnd to be fair, it works. Wulf is the villain of the story, but you can understand his anger. Helm Hammerhand is supposedly the hero of the siege at Helm's Deep, but his pride, temper and arrogance provoked the war in the first place and almost brought his people to ruin. It's almost Shakespearean in the way that the two main (male) antagonists are driven by their vices, their passions and their flaws to their own self-destruction ... which leads, of course, to Hera having to save the day.nnWhich leads to the only real false note in the film. Now, the character of Hera is brave, clever, loyal, likeable ... and yet, the opening narration (Miranda Otto, reprising her role of Eowyn) laments that there are no songs celebrating Hera's great deeds. Why wouldn't there be? Her side wins, and history is written by the victors, so the idea that the true hero of Helm's Deep would just pass half-forgotten in her people's folklore doesn't make a great deal of sense to me.nnBut that hardly spoils a genuinely enjoyable movie. It's not up there with Peter Jackson's trilogy but I rank it ahead of the TV adaptation and far, far ahead of those Hobbit travesties.nnAnd best of all, it inspired me to pick up the Lord of the Rings book for the first time in a couple of decades, so I'm very glad to have watched it.",A,05/01/2025

As a lover of the genre, I liked the movie. Especially at the beginning, although they could have explored and developed the real estate agent's journey to the castle a little more, his arrival and his acting performance when he meets Nosferatu are outstanding and perhaps the best or one of the best of all film adaptations.nnNosferatu promised a lot and had s few good disturbing scenes worthy of a truly bastard and which will remain for the Dracula filmography but the mustache put him in the category of I already know this guy...he looks like an uncle of mine or I see him a lot somewhere, maybe he looks like the baker or the hairdresser in my neighborhood. In addition, they made him too visible on more occasions than indicated, too obvious in contrast to the use of his own shadow.nnHer scenes reminded me of the Exorcist and I found them excessive. Removing some of the intensity from her role, removing the jump scares that didn't work at all and nobody needed, focusing good old Wilem Dafoe in a different way in which he would have shined at least 20 percent of what Anthony Hopkins shined in Bram Stoker's Dracula, and removing Count Orlock's mustache would have given the film a 10 and it wouldn't have seemed so long to me; the two and a half hours were very noticeable and they shouldn't have.",A,05/01/2025
rw10241118,tt6565702,X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019),"Attempting to adapt one of Marvel's most iconic storylines, Dark Phoenix falls under the weight of its ambition, delivering a lackluster conclusion to the Fox X-Men era. Unlike most others in this franchise, this installment barely had anything to offer and I found it pretty boring despite the glaring flaws the film provided some fine performances but nothing too special from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender given the material they were provided. Certain sequences such as the space mission and the final train battle had some cool elements letting each X-Men shine in their own moments and the action sequences for a brief time elevated the film. This almost feels like two movies squeezed into one leaving no room for the plot points to be explored. It is written very poorly as if the writers had not seen or read anything about the X-Men before with characters (particularly Charles Xavier) acting out of character. Jessica Chastain's character and her alien army offered no motivation and presence in the film leaving them to be very forgettable. The pacing is uneven with long stretches of nothing happening straight into rushed action. The CGI in some moments is fine but particularly in the climatic moments of the film looks horrible and outdated seeming like they were just trying to rush this one out (which they were). In a film where the emotional weight should feel very heavy, it fails to capture you emotionally and will leave you disengaged from what's going on. There is also some horrible dialogue in here and the writing fails to deliver on the narrative and emotional potential of the source material. Arriving at the end of Fox's X-Men era the film is handled with little care or passion when they should have taken time to have a grander sendoff to these characters. Overall Dark Phoenix struggles to deliver a satisfying conclusion to Fox's X-Men saga weighed down by a lackluster script, underwhelming villains, and missed opportunities to do justice to the iconic storyline it is trying to adapt.",A,05/01/2025

rw10241016,tt21823606,A Real Pain (2024),"For me this film was like watching an educational film for teenagers who hadn't learned about the holocaust before. It was a film made by Jesse Eisenberg for people that Jesse Eisenberg wanted to educate. Perhaps he had met enough people in their 20's and 30's who hadn't had the same educational experience as Woody Allen and his contemporaries had had, so this film had to be made. The impact of the holocaust on jews born in America was portrayed vividly but it was rather plastered on. As if we were made to watch a movie from a filmmaker who himself was trying to learn how to portray deep experiences in spite of being a shallow person. It's somewhat saddening that these types of films get to be made, they get the funding and the advertisement, when in fact they're made by somewhat shallow and immature people as Jesse Eisenberg who, don't get me wrong, wants to do the best tribute possible, and succeeds moderately in depicting how important it is for new generations to understand history and the horrors of holocaust, but who are just not up to anywhere near the level of filmmakers of the past. Now Woody Allen could make a film about holocaust and joke about it a lot because he lived in a world where history was taught and understood, as the filmwatchers themselves had a real connection to the holocaust, through their family experience or through school education. Unfortunately Jesse is destined to make a film about the same theme but has to inundate it with a pointless story about two cousins, which said relationship doesn't really evolve anywhere but satisfies the contemporary audience with a spectrum-set/weed-smoking/internely-disturbed character played by Kieran McCulkin, only so that it would keep the spectator involved. I hope this film be remembered as an early point on the rising learning curve of Jesse Eisenberg's films, because the intentions are perfect, the technics are great (he really knows how to drive forward a story in a hotel room without words) but the output is mediocre because what lacks is the fire, the unrelentless vigor of telling the truth, the ""I don't give a peep"" mode of life that he is already alluding to in Kieran's character. If he had made this film with the same burn of Kieran's character, this could have been a masterpiece.

First hour in the movie i was waiting for a plot to build. The villains were childish and no real threat. It wasn't interesting because pushpa was clearly going to win whatever somehow. It got boring because I knew that pushpa was going to come and solve the problem and we as the audience were going to get zero explanation or logic behind it. The ""main villain"" was a joke. And the last minute ""kidnapping"" was almost laughable because this was clearly just added in last minute without any proper context.

Like make it make sense. Ugh so annoying.nnHero Centric: OH MY GOD WE GET IT!!! HES GREAT! I DO NOT NEED EVERYONE HYPING HIM UP EVERY SECOND. He's the strongest, smartest, coolest and all of the above. THIS DOES NOT MAKE A GOOD MAIN CHARACTER. How can we root for a main character that no one can compete with. Everytime this man came onto screen, there was slow motions, music score change, and corny dialogue to make him look cool. And yes it works, BUT NOT FOR EVERY SCENE. They do this everytime and I honestly couldn't care for it. They keep trying to show how pushpa is so smart and he outwits the police but they never show us how. It just works out for pushpa like he's some sort of god. So boring and made him corny.nnLength: Every scene could have been shortened down. The fight scenes were too long. I've seen movies that have exaggerated fight scenes but nothing to this extent. He's taking down people with only his mouth... i'm not three years old, I would like some use of physics in this. That man was flying. And everyone coming at him one by one... like i've seen that in other movies but what makes it work is that the hero does get hurt and it's never that long. This scene went on for twenty minutes of everyone just coming at him individually. I was so bored. And it wasn't just this fight scene. Every scene possible. If we took out how much glazing pushpa was getting than we'd get a hour long film.nnOverall: I was so disappointed and will not be seeing the third movie.

rw10240822,tt7525778,The Package (2018/II),"This movie is not for everyone, but man did I enjoy it. I would say this movie is better with a little smoke beforehand. This movie has a really fun cast they all fill their role perfectly Eduardo Franco as Jermey, who I feel is the same role in every movie, but I find him hilarious. His twin sister Becky is played by the beautiful Geraldine Viswanathan. We also have Sadie Calvano, Daniel Dohenny, Luke Spencer Roberts to fill out the rest of the main friend group, Sarah, Sean, and Donnie.nnAfter Sean comes back home from Germany, him and his bros Jermey and Donnie plan a camping trip. After Jermey's twin sister has a breakup with her vape god boyfriend Chad, her and Sarah kind of last minute hop on the camping trip. You know exactly what they're doing with the Chad character. He is played by Alexander Calvert who did a great job at the douche character. I will say I really enjoyed the movie but I think the first 2/3 are the best. I love the chemistry between the cast they do really seem like friends. Jermey getting a fake ID, saying he's a solider is great I love how they use it later, when trying to find Jermey in the hospital. I know the cast don't look like high schoolers but whatever, they're close they look more like college kids, but that's exactly what they were. I don't really care though the movie is funny and they don't look like they're in the 30's so that's fine. I love the car trip up there it's pretty short but Sean folding with Becky and Donnie's cutting edge commentary on the situation.nnAfter getting to the camp they all start drinking and acting like high schoolers. Sean is trying to get with Becky who has only been broken up for 17 hours. So we have the classic will they won't they. I really enjoy the akward acting from Daniel and the kind of opposite approach from Geraldine who is more confident and quick witted I enjoy the contrast and she made me laugh multiple times from her quick wit. Sean had a chance to get with her before at a party but dungoofed and denied a request to smoke with her on the roof. The dialogue and writing isn't the most complex premise but the writing for the characters I find so well done, it just makes it feel more like friends like when Sean and Donnie are insulting each other when they first see each other again. Or when Donnie makes fun of Sean for denying the smoke with Becky when they smoke all the time. Or Donnie sending snap chats while Sean is flopping with trying to riz up Becky. As well as Becky's quick witted remarks to make it less awkward when Sean drops the condom in front of her at the hospital.nnAfter spending the night partying Sean is about to score with Becky when it's interrupted again, by Jermey cutting his weiner off and yes that's the main premise the group of friends trying to get their friends penis back to him after giving the wrong cooler to the evac crew. It's silly it's obsurd, but that's why I love these movies. Same with Game Over Man. I love these types of movies and I should mention this movie was made by the Workaolics crew, so if you're not into that type of comedy this prolly isn't your cup of tea. A penis is cut off in Game over man too, geez these guys got thing for cutting of male parts I guess. The funniest parts for me are them trying to get the penis. Like Sean trying to suck the venom out of the wiener after thinking a snake left poison in it after biting it. Them returning to the gas station and the guy running it cleaning it and making it beautiful after thinking a vet lost his penis. He also said this wasn't his first time doing this. Micheal Eklund did a phenomenal job in this role, he really killed it. Drinking the pop while cleaning it or shooting bows at the gang after finding out the truth and hitting Donnie. One random trait about Jermey I found hillarious was him trying to get Sean to bang his sister it's dumb af, but has some good moments like Jermey giving him the King condom and then Sean dropping it later at the hospital while talking to Becky. Also Sean random boners whenever Becky touches but honestly even if she's near him he has a boner. I love the scene when they're still in the woods and steal a boat from a dad his son but not before scarring the innocence away from an 11 year old kid, by interrogating the kid pretty much into giving them their dads sports boat key. Also love part when it like turns into like a drama for a second when Sean sacrifices one for the team to you know suck the venom out, that's not there.nnSome things I didn't care for, it's little but they kept going to the wrong hospital I get it like once but they did it like 3 times. I liked how they tied in Jermey's fake ID with finding him at the right hospital. Of couse they have a part where the crew kind of have a falling out, and it doesn't last long and the ending is pretty cliche and obvious. The falling out occurs because back at the camp when Jermey initially cut his crouch off. Sean took all the phones to try to get reception and call help and I guess the liquor had some influence on the situation but he didn't seem that messed up. He ends up texting Chad and calling him a taint and a few other things, acting like he's Becky, when Chad wants her back and says he's sorry. Yea that guy wasn't gonna change. A little later a voicemail is heard and it's Chad calling Becky a taint the whole car hears it, and at the time Becky think it's just Chad being a douche, which he is. Towards the end of the movie Donnie is mad at Sean and lets it slip that he sent the text that instigated the voicemail and she's mad at him obviously. They kind of go all their separate ways after going through all the work and accidentally give Jemreys penis to another biker dude who lost his junk from a crazy junkie. After a little motivation speech to the biker dude he has a change of heart and let's them take his penis that was just flushed out from the sewers. Yes she cut it off and flushed it down the toilet. The junkie shows up and cuts it off again, which I wasn't a huge fan of felt a little forced. The biker is also Blake from workaholics played by Blake Anderson, it was great to see him again. After the crazy mishap at the hospital Sean and Donnie run into Sarah and Becky who has just called Chad and was gonna go with him. Sean has his end of movie speech to win over girl and I do like how didn't nail it he was awkward. It's just cliche you know. But I do like how she said it was not a good speech. But I did think he nailed the part of not being with a cheater and being with someone who respects like he does. It's cheesy but it was effective. She leaves Chad and they go deliver their friends and brothers jewels.nnThis is my favorite part of the ending where it turns into like an action movie and they get to the hospital and rush through the hospital knocking over hospital personnel, security guards, and anyone in their way. Sean delivers it just in time before Jermey was gonna have to do some crazy surgery. I like part where Sean and Becky are about to kiss but she can't because he sucked her bothers kingdom come earlier. I love the last shot of the I'm guessing drone shot of Becky and Sean finally kissing before taking him back to the airport to go back to Germany. Jermey returning in the wheelchair and trying to see Sean and Becky kiss. Also forgot to mention this whole movie Jermey swore he was talking to a girl named Kendall Jenners who everyone swore was a catfish but she was actually real and hot. I also didn't mention but Donnie and Sarah have been in some hot water, I think partially because Donnie might have started something saying they were together when they weren't, while Sarah actually liked him. He's known for doing this by admitting to making the rumor of Sean not in Germany actually in rehab for bath salts. But by the end you know some movie magic they have a moment and they are together by the end too. It's a happy ending. I love the dialogue as well as the drone shot is going. This movie is fun, and I highly enjoyed it watching it with my brother. I had never seen the whole thing only clips. So it was nice to actually see it. Not for everyone but I know this is gonna be a guilty pleasure one for me just like Game Over Man.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240817,tt0026174,Captain Blood (1935),"""Captain Blood"" was such a worldwide success in the mid thirties that it made overnight stars of Eroll Flynn and Olivia de Haviland and created a demand for action-adventure films that produced some of the best films ever in the genre. For the first half of the thirties the swashbuckling film was seen as something left behind in the twenties, with Douglas Fairbanks. There was also a problem with early, cumbersome sound equipment being unable to work well with fast action and outdoor locations. But the success of ""Treasure Island"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" in 1934 showed the film audience still had an appetite for these kinds of films.nnSo Warner Brothers took a gamble, and what a gamble it turned out to be. Although the studio had allotted a really big budget for the film, most of the other important aspects seemed to be left to chance. It was given to director Michael Curtiz who up to then had directed mostly minor films with a few exceptions like ""Cabin In the Cotton"" and ""The Kennel Murder Case"". He would receive the first of five Best Director nominations from the Academy for this film. It ended up starring two virtual unknowns. Errol Flynn had filmed a flop in Australia and in Hollywood had had only small parts in three minor films. Olivia de Haviland had appeared in only three previous films. Writer Casey Robinson had written titles in the silent era but had only begun writing screenplays two years before.nnThough putting a film like this in the hands of a bunch of unknowns would seem totally mad, somehow it worked and in the biggest way possible. All of these principals went on to big careers for the next decade and more. Curtiz's fluid camera technique using movement and unusual camera angles was ideal for the genre. Flynn instantly became one of Hollywood's biggest stars, especially in adventure films. He and Olivia de Haviland had such chemistry that they appeared in eight films together. She was a fine dramatic actress in future films and won Academy Awards for ""To Each His Own"" and ""The Heiress"". Curtiz would go on to direct ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Casablanca"", ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". Robinson went on to write some of the biggest films of Flynn and Bette Davis. This is reminiscent of ""Laura"", which also had a cast and crew of unknowns who went on to big careers.nn""Captain Blood"" falls into two parts of almost equal length. The first part involves the unfair enslavement of Dr. Peter Blood - it's his name not a pirate moniker as the title might suggest. - The attraction that grows between him and Arabella Bishop is forbidden because of his status and creates complications. Part two is the pirate story, a story of a rare pirate of noble character with a strict code of ethics, which makes his pirating suitable for a hero's story. And is Flynn ever a hero. His natural charisma and ability to inspire and lead men practically jumps out of the screen. He's also intelligent, well spoken and as gentlemanly as Ronald Colman but highly athletic as well.nnThe love story ties the two parts together. And Olivia de Havilland is as perfect in her role as Flynn is in his. She's not just beautiful and complemented by the period costumes, but self assured, playful and feisty as well. The actress always brought great intelligence to her roles when she could, though the studio often gave her one dimensional sweet and innocent ingenue parts that required very little.nnThey are supported by a fine cast. In Blood's crew there's the gunner, Hagthorpe, played by Guy Kibbee, who had been a regular in Warner's Busby Berkeley musicals but who handles this part really well. Ross Alexander plays young Jeremy Pitt, in a winning way, a choice role for this up and coming actor. There are two villains here, a recurring element in Flynn's action films. The first is Colonel Bishop (Arabella's uncle), played by Lionel Atwill, who is entirely despicable. He has one funny moment when he thinks his money has been saved from a Spanish warship but is basically a one dimensional character. More nuanced is French pirate Levasseur, played with great charm overlying his villainy by Basil Rathbone. It would have been nice to bring him on sooner as he's a complex and potentially interesting character. Rathbone would be one of films' great villains three years later in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood."" Henry Stephenson is a paternal Royal Envoy bringing good tidings, and Vernon Steele is a rather nasty King James II.nnThere's lots of English history going on here in the period of the Restoration. The film begins with the Monmouth Rebellion, an attempt to depose James II and put his older brother's (Charles II) illegitimate son, James Scott, First Duke of Monmouth on the throne and ends with the Glorious Revolution which sent James II to France and put William and Mary on the throne. In the thirties more people knew about these events as English history was a school staple. Fortunately you don't need to know anything at all about it, as the film telegraphs how one should feel and is not trying to teach history.nnThis is a splendid action film in the grandest style and the mix of special effects would have looked pretty incredible in the thirties. The ships and sea battles are still impressive despite moments of knowing some segments are models. High points are an invasion of Port Royal by Spanish pirates and a battle between Flynn's ship and two French frigates, both spectacularly realized. But the film, for all its action, is held together by the presence of Flynn and de Havilland. Also supporting the film with great verve is the gloriously heroic score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. This stirring music is the other thread that holds the film together and surprisingly was the first time background music was used in this way. It's something to say, but this 85 year old film holds up just as well now as it was when it was new.",A,05/01/2025

It has several really good action scenes. If I'm not mistaken, it's set during the Civil War or something like that, and the war scenes are also really good.nnThe story tells of three men: the good, the bad, and the ugly. The synopsis shows that it's focused on a treasure hidden in a cemetery. But the movie has trouble focusing on that. Even though the title of the movie seems to focus on three characters, the bad character barely appears in the movie, and in the final scene he appears in a very casual way. The plot focuses much more on the good and the ugly, initially as friends, then enemies, and then they help each other again. But their relationship seems good and is well developed.nnThe film is almost three hours long, and the part I mentioned about the main objective only starts after an hour. When I saw how long the film was, I was a little apprehensive, but the film is not completely boring, obviously it could have been shorter, but it develops well. The film's script is very good, it doesn't leave any loose ends or introduce characters with too much screen time who are useless, as is the case in other Clint Eastwood films, and it doesn't leave any obvious loose ends (I didn't notice after watching it only once).nnThe film's photography is very good, the action scenes, both shooting and explosions in the war, are very good and really intriguing, the main actors are good, but in terms of audiovisual, the main highlight is the soundtracks, which are very iconic and very good indeed.

The bar, which began in the late 70s as a queer haven in dangerously homophobic Edmonton, Alberta, soon developed into a thriving and gloriously salacious mecca for queers from all over the continent. For me the true joy of the film was seeing and hearing witnesses who were there during the 10-odd years that marked the club's apogee: the owner, staff, customers, costumers, hairdressers and make-up artists for the legendary drag shows, all of whom are articulate, brazen and defiant in the face of community hostility, oppressive police and, eventually, devastating AIDS. As LGBTQ bars now are disappearing all over North America, Flashback shows how essential and supportive they could be in a time of grave crisis.

rw10240655,tt0113277,Heat (1995),"With the news that a prequel / sequel to this groundbreaking film is currently in the works in the form of [link=tt27351074], perhaps it is time to revisit the greatest ""clash of the titans"" ever committed to film. [link=nm0000520]'s 1995 Los Angeles crime saga clocks in at just over three hours, and stars two of America's greatest acting talents: [link=nm0000199] and [link=nm0000134] (who will not be returning for the next installment). But one only need watch approximately half of that time in order to understand why [link=tt0113277] sets the standard by which any and all future pairings of these two cinematic giants will be rated. And it is not just the infamous Coffee Shop scene which provides an excuse to love this film; though said scene is certainly well worth waiting for. (More on this in a moment.) No, the secret to this film creeps into frame at the very moment that the L. A. metro train glides effortlessly toward the viewer - surrounded by smoke and creaking slowly along - carrying inside a silent, brooding and patient master thief, Neil McCauley (masterfully played by DeNiro). And the secret to loving this film is just that... patience.nnOne would expect a crime drama starring [link=nm0000134] and [link=nm0000199] (in their first ""real"" pairing in film history as most agree that [link=tt0071562] does not really count since the two mega-stars never actually share the screen) to begin with a bang. And therein lies Mann's genius. Does Mann choose to open this much anticipated cops-n-robbers action flick with a Hollywood-style, big box office bonanza of explosions and shrapnel? Nope. Instead Mann eases us into the environment that these two alpha-males will inhabit by way of a train ride. The doors slide open and out into the night steps McCauley. There is no evidence of the carnage to come as McCauley appears, only a hint of his expertise as he silently scans his surroundings, searching for a sign of anything out of order.nnFast forward to a bedroom. Morning brings with it the promise of lovemaking, as we are introduced in a vastly different way to the man who will become McCauley's adversary, Detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (who we will come to realize is an over the top manic played brilliantly by Pacino). Hanna and his wife Justine, (played with seductive aplomb by [link=nm0893204]) are having a moment... one neither wants interrupted. Lucky for everyone involved - characters and viewers alike - no interruption presents itself, and both are allowed to finish. Little do either know that this will be their last such moment together. For on the horizon lie several days of complicated cat and mouse antics, punctuated by the smell of cordite and the sight of death.nnAnd then comes the big bang. With an expertly planned and craftily executed tractor-trailer-rig-into armored-car smash-up, McCauley and his crew (portrayed by a world weary [link=nm0000174] in what many consider his finest performance, a still high in real life [link=nm0001744] and a gritty faced [link=nm0001803]) are off to the races. And what follows is the stuff of legend. Only not all of what is presented is legend... much of it is true to life.nn[link=tt0113277] was born out of a 1989 television pilot also penned by Mann, entitled [link=tt0097700], and most if not all of TAKEDOWN appears in the script for [link=tt0113277] . (Unfortunately, TAKEDOWN is only available on DVD in Region 2 countries, but is well worth viewing if you can grab a copy.) TAKEDOWN itself was based in part on stories Mann was told by his good friend and [link=tt0090410] collaborator [link=nm0011477]. Adamson (along with STORY's [link=nm0001199]) worked as a Detective in the Chicago Police Department's Major Crimes Unit in the late 60's, and was responsible for taking down the real life Neil McCauley. In fact, the two actually had a face to face in a local coffee shop... just as DeNiro and Pacino do in [link=tt0113277]. And the outcome was much the same.nnWhen the fateful scene finally comes... boy is it worth the wait. Having tracked McCauley's scent for several days through cold-blooded murders to successful and aborted heists, Hanna decides to up the ante and confront the man himself. He suggest a cup of joe and the two sit down for a chat. What transpires is by far the meatiest mano-y-mano ever committed to film. As the two cautiously attempt to relate to one another, they each discover that they share a common principle: They are each unflinchingly committed to one thing and one thing only. For McCauley that one thing is remaining true to his instincts and guarding himself against becoming attached to, as he puts it, ""anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner."" For Hanna, that commitment is to tracking the scent of his prey and holding onto his angst, which, according to Hanna, is the thing that ""keeps me sharp... on the edge... where I gotta be."" And it is within this discussion of their two intersecting lives, punctuated by dark words and veiled threats, that the most observant of viewers will glean a probing glimpse into the psyche of both actors. And Mann knew it when he wrote the dialogue.nnDeNiro: ""It is what it is. Its either that or we better both go do something else, pal.""nPacino: ""I don't know how to do anything else.""nDeNiro: ""Neither do I.""nPacino: ""I don't much want to either.""nDeNiro: ""Neither do I.""nnThen both men smile.... barely. Want to know why? Because at this very moment, both men are exposing their true feelings about acting, NOT (as some may think) discussing their character's feelings about their chosen profession. DeNiro and Pacino have let their guard down ever so briefly, and shown the world why they are the best of the best.nnBut this film is not all about De Niro and Pacino chewing up the scenery and each other. Costars Kilmer and Sizemore (in their roles as McCauley's right-hand men Chris Shirherlis and Michael Cheritto respectively), [link=nm0000685] (as McCauley's wounded and dogged fence Nate), [link=nm0000204] (as Hanna's tortured step-daughter Lauren Gustafson), [link=nm0932112], [link=nm0836071] and [link=nm0505971] (as Hanna's fellow Detectives in the Robbery Homicide Division Drucker, Casals and Bosko respectively), [link=nm0000171] (as Shirherlis' caught between love and the right path wife Charlene) and [link=nm0000312] (as McCauley's lied to and frail girlfriend Eady) add so much depth to this film that it takes several viewings to fully digest the three course meal that Mann serves up. The interlocking stories of each character's life, filled with despair, pain and - at times - hope, move [link=tt0113277]nfrom the genre of ""yet another cops-n-robbers flick"" into the realm of ""cinema masterpiece.""nnAnd as for Mann's directing... Mann is THE MAN. His use of light and shadow, along with his bold and signature over-the-shoulder camera angels create a visual canvass that places the viewer squarely in mid '90's Los Angeles. Showing off the seamy underbelly of late night L. A., Mann uses this film to expose locations and scents only hinted at in former films such as [link=tt0090180]. (Mann would eventually expose more of this environment while producing the television series [link=tt0315686] - a show sadly lacking a Blu-ray / DVD release - and while directing the [link=nm0000129] / [link=nm0004937] show down film [link=tt0369339].)nnMann is one of the cinemas most daring and detailed Directors, and this film is a high water mark in his ever expanding career. It is no wonder that fans of both [link=tt0113277] and [link=tt0097700] feel strongly that the former expands and betters the latter by leaps and bounds. [link=tt0113277] is the once and for all standard by which any and all future pairings of De Niro and Pacino will be rated. And none will match up. None could. (If you require proof, just have a look at the sorely disappointing [link=tt1034331]). Give this film a little patience and you will surely be rewarded. Because it is the slow build that really pays off.nnWhile stalking the crime scene that follows the previously mentioned armored car heist, Hanna offers this observation to describe McCauley's crew:nn""The M. O. is that they're good.""nnIt's not just McCauley's crew that are good. They ALL are. And so is this film. It will leave you itching for the next chapter... coming soon... I hope.",A,05/01/2025

rw10240571,tt0118799,La vita è bella (1997),"Life Is Beautiful, directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, is a poignant blend of comedy and tragedy that explores the horrors of the Holocaust through the eyes of a loving father determined to shield his son from the grim realities of their situation. Balancing lighthearted humor with heartbreaking drama, the film crafts a unique narrative that celebrates the human spirit even in the darkest of times.nnBenigni's performance as Guido is magnetic, effortlessly transitioning between moments of joy, wit, and profound emotional depth. His chemistry with Nicoletta Braschi, who plays his wife Dora, is tender and endearing, grounding the film's early, whimsical scenes in genuine warmth. Giorgio Cantarini as the young Giosuè delivers a performance filled with innocence and charm, embodying the hope that drives Guido's protective actions.nnThe film's first half unfolds as a romantic comedy, filled with Benigni's signature physical humor and exuberant charm. However, the shift to the harrowing backdrop of a Nazi concentration camp in the second half introduces a tonal complexity that underscores the resilience of the human spirit. Benigni's ability to infuse moments of levity into an overwhelmingly bleak setting highlights the power of imagination and love as tools for survival.nnWhile the film's sentimentality and use of humor in a Holocaust narrative have sparked debate, its message of hope and the lengths to which a parent will go to protect their child's innocence resonate deeply. The cinematography and Nicola Piovani's Oscar-winning score further enhance the emotional weight of the story.nnLife Is Beautiful is a bold and unconventional film that, despite its polarizing approach, leaves an indelible mark.

Astin, in particular, shines as Sam, embodying unyielding loyalty and quiet heroism. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn comes into his own as the reluctant king, delivering a performance that balances nobility and vulnerability. Ian McKellen's Gandalf and Andy Serkis's Gollum continue to captivate, while the ensemble cast, including Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill, adds richness to the sprawling narrative.nnJackson's direction is nothing short of visionary. The epic battles, particularly the Siege of Minas Tirith, are stunningly choreographed, blending practical effects and CGI to create awe-inspiring set pieces. The film's quieter moments, such as Frodo and Sam's final push to Mount Doom, are equally compelling, driven by Howard Shore's evocative score that heightens both grandeur and poignancy.nnWhile the film's extended runtime allows for a comprehensive conclusion, its multiple endings may test the patience of some viewers. However, these moments provide closure to the story's many arcs, making the journey feel complete.nnThe Return of the King is a towering achievement that brings Tolkien's epic tale to life with unparalleled artistry and emotional resonance.

While ambitious in scope and stunning in execution, it occasionally falters under the weight of its sprawling narrative.nnElijah Wood continues to deliver a compelling performance as Frodo, whose journey grows darker with the increasing burden of the One Ring. Sean Astin as Sam provides heartfelt support, while Andy Serkis's groundbreaking portrayal of Gollum is a highlight, capturing the character's internal struggle with remarkable nuance. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, and Orlando Bloom excel in their respective roles, though the divided storylines leave some characters underdeveloped.nnJackson's visual direction remains exceptional, with breathtaking battles like Helm's Deep showcasing his mastery of large-scale action. The detailed world-building immerses viewers in the grandeur and peril of Middle-earth, with CGI and practical effects seamlessly blending to create iconic moments. Howard Shore's score once again enriches the emotional and dramatic weight of the story.nnHowever, the film's narrative suffers from pacing issues, with certain segments feeling overly drawn out while others seem rushed. The constant shift between storylines, though necessary, sometimes dilutes the emotional intensity and momentum. While the themes of loyalty, courage, and the corrupting influence of power remain strong, the film feels like a bridge between the more focused first installment and the climactic finale.nnThe Two Towers is an ambitious middle chapter that expands the world and stakes of the trilogy but struggles to balance its intricate plotlines. It's a visually stunning epic that sets the stage for a grand conclusion but lacks the narrative cohesion of its predecessor.nnRating: 6/10 - A visually impressive but uneven continuation of the saga.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240563,tt15333788,Out of the Blue (2022/II),"Positively the worst movie ever made about a public librarian. Goofy characters, ghastly story, cold and manipulative women, moronic men, sex without any kind of excitement. PALMETTO and WILD THINGS came out in the Nineties, and at the time people said those movies were bad rip-offs of classic film noir.nnBut those two movies were DOUBLE INDEMNITY compared to this mess.nnI like Diane Kruger. She was brilliant in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. She was lovely in TROY. Why on earth would she ever agree to this? Her character is so lifeless, boring, empty, and at the same time needy and cruel. Was this some lost clause in the Treaty of Versaille?nnARTICLE 15: Once every 50 years a stunning German actress must come to American and be humiliated by a no-name director and make a movie where she is stupid and evil and does all the stupid things people laugh at Germans for doing. Except for eating sauerkraut and drinking beer!",A,05/01/2025
rw10240558,tt0120737,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001),"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson, is a cinematic masterpiece that brought J. R. R. Tolkien's rich world of Middle-earth to life with stunning detail and emotional depth. As the first installment of the epic trilogy, the film sets a high standard for storytelling, blending breathtaking visuals, compelling characters, and a powerful narrative.nnElijah Wood delivers a heartfelt performance as Frodo Baggins, the reluctant hero burdened with the fate of the world. Ian McKellen shines as Gandalf, embodying wisdom and strength, while Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean add gravitas to their roles as members of the Fellowship. The ensemble cast, including Cate Blanchett as the ethereal Galadriel, enhances the film's emotional resonance and brings Tolkien's iconic characters to life.nnPeter Jackson's direction is visionary, seamlessly combining practical effects with groundbreaking CGI to create a fully realized world. The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand serve as a stunning backdrop, while Howard Shore's unforgettable score amplifies the film's epic scale and emotional beats. From the idyllic Shire to the perilous Mines of Moria, every frame is meticulously crafted, immersing viewers in the grandeur of Middle-earth.nnThe screenplay, adapted by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, skillfully condenses Tolkien's dense prose without losing its essence. Themes of friendship, courage, and the corrupting influence of power are woven throughout, resonating deeply with audiences. However, the film's pacing can occasionally feel uneven, with moments of exposition slowing the momentum.nnDespite minor flaws, The Fellowship of the Ring is a landmark achievement in fantasy cinema, setting the stage for an unforgettable trilogy. It's a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of Tolkien's world.nnRating: 8/10 - A visually stunning and emotionally engaging start to a legendary journey.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240544,tt4593138,"""Stranger Things"" (2016) {Chapter Eight: The Upside Down (#1.8)}","The story is fine. A good wrap up to the initial season. Has all the usual tropes and character behaviors one would expect from an 80s era style horror/comedy/suspense. The kids are the stars still as they are with the entire season... Now let's get to the problem..nnHas anyone ever seen a Michael Bay film? Transformers? Bad boys? There's this action production sequence where they just randomly flash between stuff at 1k mph. Easier to ignore in those films. However here it's with darkness and flickering lights for multiple sequences (it also rears it's ugly head in season 2 as well). Not only is it but not good action, you can't just flicker lights to give me the appearance of great action... But it is seizure inducing and the lack of epilepsy warning at the star of the episode should illicit grounds for lawsuit. It really is that bad. So much so that this is a re-watch for me because I had to stop watching at the end of season 2 because of this.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240542,tt22893404,Maria (2024/III),"The film Maria, directed by Pablo Larraín, defies the expectations it creates in its audience. Contrary to what one might anticipate, it is not a biographical film about an opera singer but rather a psychological exploration of the loneliness of a woman who happens to be an opera singer and has turned to a kind of emotional masochism and self-destruction.nnIf you approach Maria expecting a biographical film that narrates the life story of an opera singer, you will likely be disappointed. By the end of the film, not only do you not truly know Maria, but the film deliberately leaves you with ambiguities. Questions arise about why she enters a relationship with a wealthy man, why she has a child with him, why she loses weight, and even about her relationships with her two servants. This intentional lack of clarity led me to turn to Wikipedia after watching the film, hoping to find answers about Maria's life.nnThe film begins with Maria's death and ends with her death, creating a closed cycle in which we accompany her during her final days. Through two distinct layers-black-and-white imagery depicting scenes from her past, and low-quality color footage showing fragments of her life-we witness a woman in the throes of a midlife crisis at fifty-three, succumbing to self-destruction. While the film intentionally leaves gaps in Maria's story, there are subtle hints that contribute to understanding the characters. For instance, Onassis's reference to Hermes from Greek mythology, and his claim that he himself is Hermes, helps the viewer grasp his character. Hermes, after all, was a trickster and a mediator between mortals and the gods of Olympus.nnOverall, Maria excels in direction, atmosphere, and lighting, effectively conveying the sense of loneliness experienced by its protagonist. However, if your goal is to learn about Maria the opera singer through this film, it is unlikely to offer much insight.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240539,tt2948356,Zootopia (2016),Incredible movie the story no words im too exited for the sequel. And this was like and for me being a movie of Disney. And i like the music that was incredible its the best movie of disney in my opinion because it is a Fable like a bugs lyfe of 1998 and the adventure of two characters in a animal world. Also in my opinion Judy Hops is a great protagonist and Nick too good explanation of the animal kindom. The mammals are like not too much good after all for the thing they doesn't kill but well the movie talk about that because they are in a city named zootopia good thing because at the end they are not killing.,A,05/01/2025
rw10240537,tt21823606,A Real Pain (2024),"This film is just awful. The lead actors act with sentiments, which are hopelessly unrealistic. The remainder of the cast a superfluous add-on. The scenery is bland, the emotions do not match the action, there is no real depth to the plot. Indeed the train from Warsaw is the only real Polish entity that is shown in any depth,nnThe ""buddies"" are like oil and water with little sign that they even know much about each other. Their main interaction is smoking marijuana in a country where it is quite illegal.nnThe ""Jewish"" scenery is minimal and almost irrelevant.nnThe cousins talk about their holocaust survivor grandmother, Dory, but provide no real emotion or detail about her. Eighty-five years after the Nazi invasion of Poland the fact that grandma's old home still stands is surprising. However, the fact that the residence has no discernible Jewish elements is unremarkable.nnGo see a better movie, like Ishtar. This one a bigger turkey than a float in a Thanksgiving day parade.",A,05/01/2025
rw10240530,tt30057084,Babygirl (2024),"Worst movie I've ever seen. If I could give negative a thousand stars I would. I'd rather re-watch The Human Centipede than ever watch this crap again. A wholesome story about an aging woman who risks her marriage and career for an affair with a fumbling idiot who isn't even very hot and then she ultimately has zero consequences at the end. I'm sure it was aiming for artsy and edgy (maybe even empowering?) but missed completely.nnNicole Kidman has an amazing plastic surgeon for her body, not so much for her face (which we spend half of the movie staring directly into while she fakes oragams). The actor who plays the idiot she has an affair with annoyed the crap out of me because he's wishy washy with his dominance; one minute he seems confident the next confused and angry. Ok, she wants something dangerous and exciting, but why this semi attractive, semi assertive reject? He's not so much sexy as he is creepy, so much so I was expecting some sort of Fatal Attraction twist (which would have, maybe, made the movie interesting, but alas another disappointment). Antonio Banderas was amazing in this movie. He is the only believable character.nnThe sex scenes were more odd than hot to me. Before you get upset and say, ""You just don't like kinky stuff or dom/sub stuff,"" let me assure you that you are wrong. I just like good acting, a good story line, and believable dominance portrayal. I think they were trying to push boundaries but the actual sex scenes were lack luster and repetitive. If you like being sightly treated like a dog or cat before mediocre sex, this movie is for you.",A,05/01/2025

And a story that has never been less or more up-to-date then to now. More and more corruption world wide revealed, this series talks to the audience giving the chance to oberseve the world wide mechanisms of enabling corruption starting within ones own family home. The film does not give directive to what is right or wrong but again gives masterfully space to come to ones own realisations and conclusion. No sex money making lame blockbuster as let's face it so many are. Grand acting and video editing and cut as well. More please.",A,05/01/2025
